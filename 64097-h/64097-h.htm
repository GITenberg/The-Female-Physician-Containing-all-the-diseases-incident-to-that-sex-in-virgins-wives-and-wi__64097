I Have generally observ’d,
that <i>Men</i> address their
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Works</em></span> to improper
Hands; <i>some</i> aim at <i>Personages</i>
too great, to regard them;
<i>others</i> stoop to <i>Men</i> too unlearned,
to defend them: <i>Some</i> again make
their <i>Court</i> and apply to Persons in
Vogue or in Place, and <i>others</i>
cringe and creep after <i>Purse-proud
Patrons</i>: But as I pursue not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>the common Designs of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Dedicators</span></em>,
so I have studied no
subterfuges of <i>Flattery</i>, nor Flourishes
of <i>Panegyrick</i> in this <span class='sc'>Dedication</span>.
I know, that, whatever
my <i>Performance</i> may prove, a
<i>substantial</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Work</span></em> will stand securely
upon its own Bottom, and
make its way into the World,
without any <i>secondary Helps</i>;
whereas a slight <i>Defective Piece</i>
will fall and be quash’d, tho’ it
should even <i>strut</i> with <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Majesty</span></em>
itself in its glaring <i>Front</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Had I then presum’d upon any
particular <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Voucher</span></em> for the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Female
Physician</span></em>, it would
have look’d like acknowledging
<i>Guilt</i> and seeking for <i>Defence</i>; Because
<i>You</i>, and none else, are the
<i>competent Judges</i> in Affairs of
this Nature: <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> having entrusted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span><i>you</i> only with the <i>Lives</i> of
Men; and <i>you</i> (under <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Him</span></em>) being
the Sole <i>Preservers</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Life</span></em>
and the great <i>Distributers</i> of
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Health</span></em>, I have thought it
my <i>Duty</i> to make this solemn
Application to <i>your August Societies</i>
in general; and in this manner
to render you some small <i>Account</i>
of the <i>TALENT</i>, which
some of your selves have entrusted
me with for <i>Improvement</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>In fine, your <i>famous Fraternities</i>
being universally celebrated for encouraging
of <i>Learning</i> and promoting
<i>Ingenuity</i>, You are still the
more highly entitled to my <i>Endeavours</i>
in both respects; and I
my self in all points of <i>Humanity</i>
the more secure of your candid <i>Interpretation</i>.
The <i>undertaking</i> then
being yours by <i>Birth</i>, it has a Natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>Claim to your <i>Care</i>; And it
being the <i>Duty</i> of Men to provide
for their <i>Off-Spring</i>, it has a peculiar
Right to your <i>Patronage</i>.
Wherefore, with all due <i>Deference</i>
and becoming <i>Submission</i> to your
<i>wiser Judgments</i>, I lay the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Dedication</span></em>
as well as the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Work</span></em> it
self entirely at your Feet, in Hopes

<em class='gesperrt'>As</em> the Study of <i>Physick</i> has differ’d
in every Age, according to the prevailing
Opinions and Ambiguous
Determinations of <i>Philosophers</i>, so
the Practice of <i>Midwifery</i> has also
varied, according to the Judicious Experiments
and successful Operations of <i>Professors</i>;
until of late Years, by the many happy
Discoveries and strict Inquiries made into the
Secrets of Nature, and Natural Causes, these
Healing and obstetricious <i>Arts</i> are so much
improv’d and advanc’d, that, they now seem
to be arriv’d at their very Height of <i>Perfection</i>:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>Insomuch that both the <i>one</i> and the
<i>other</i> stand this Day upon as sure a Foundation,
and as certain Principles, as most other
<i>Sciences</i> do, which notwithstanding are not
exempted from the Fate of <i>Casualties</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> Case then being so, it becomes all
Men of Ingenuity and Integrity, to be also
<i>Communicative</i> of such Things, as may tend
to the Welfare of their Neighbours and to the
Common Good of Mankind; since according
to the Excellent <i>Poet</i>,</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> was the Principle of the <i>Ancients</i>,
who, as they discover’d the Natural Debility of
the <i>Female Sex</i>, and that Women were not only
Subject to all Diseases in common with Men,
but also obnoxious to a vast many Distempers
peculiarly singular to themselves, were first
mov’d to write particular <i>Books</i>, and respective
<i>Treatises</i>, upon these Heads: The most wise
and divine <i>Hippocrates</i>, first breaking the Ice,
after him <i>Diocles</i>, next <i>Aetius</i>, and at last many
<i>others</i>; For the more Learned and Ingenious
that any one found himself in his respective
Age, the more readily he exercis’d himself in
these difficult Points.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>Affectionum, Libros ex Libris facientes,
Bibliothecas voluminibus oneratas, de Nostris
inter ea diris ac difficillimis Cruciatibus,
nulla vel exigua, &amp; ea quidem satis oscitanter
mentione factâ</span></i>”: That <i>Men</i>, in short,
study their own Good, and take more Care of
Themselves than of the <i>Women</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BECAUSE</em> then there are so many
Faults and Defects in this part of <i>Physick</i>; in
that the <i>Antients</i>, by reason of their precise
Gravity, rendred their <i>Works</i> either obscure, or
at least difficult to be understood: As <i>some</i> of
the more <i>modern Authors</i> have, treated them
but Partially and Defectively in most respects;
<i>others</i> but transiently and indifferently, or as if
they were otherways employ’d: <i>Some</i> again
darkly and briefly; <i>others</i> so confusedly and
prolixly, that we may justly say to them, as
the <i>Lacedemonians</i> did to the <i>Samian Legats</i>
of old; “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prioris orationis vestræ partis sumus
obliti, postremam ob primæ oblivionem
non intelleximus</span></i>”: We have forgot the Beginning
of your Discourse, and for that reason,
cannot understand the latter Part.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> being the Reasons of this Undertaking,
I shall trouble you with no farther
<i>Apologies</i> in its behalf, save only that I thought
it my Duty, notwithstanding the Considerable
<i>Charge</i> and immense <i>Labour</i>, not only so far to
endeavour to imitate my <i>Predecessors</i>, but also
to deserve well of Humane Kind, and particularly
of <i>English Women</i>: <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>First</span></em> by collecting
these things, which I have found clearly
written by the most approved <i>Authors</i>, together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>with what I have conceiv’d to be true and Rational
by my own painful Study, frequent Speculation,
and assiduous Practice; and <span class='sc'>Secondly</span> by
publishing this <i>Praxis</i> and <i>Analysis</i> of Women’s
Distempers, as they are accurately, tho’ succinctly
comprehended in this small <i>Volume</i>: Yet not
so briefly neither, but that most Things are
consider’d and explain’d for removing <i>Obscurity</i>;
nor so prolixly, that any Head is swell’d with
Trifles or empty Words: And that not only
in our vernacular <i>Tongue</i>, but also in a certain
middle <i>Style</i>, adapted to the Capacity of the
meanest <i>Reader</i>; so that if it be possible, where
the <i>Flowers</i> are thinnest Sown, there the <i>Fruit</i>
may appear the thickest; Because I have all along
consider’d this to be no Work of <i>Eloquence</i>, but
of <i>Midwifery</i>, or <i>Physick</i>, or <i>both</i> together, if
you please, in which I have studied the common
Good, but no vain Glory.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> composing the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Work</span></em>, I have follow’d
such Methods as seem’d to me the most conducive
towards its Use and Design, and insisted
only upon such <i>Topicks</i>, as can be most serviceable
to the World, and absolutely necessary in
the Practice of either of these <i>Arts</i>; without
touching upon any of the pompous Superfluities,
with which <i>Physick</i>, as well as other <i>Professions</i>,
is now a-days over-run and embarrass’d:
The <i>one</i> I apprehended to concern my Integrity,
and the <i>other</i> only an empty Applause. But that
you may be at no Loss in conceiving the Regularity
of my Method, because of the variety of
Subjects to be met with, I shall here delineate
or draw out the <i>Lines</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Work</span></em>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>give you some distant <i>Idea</i> of it, if possible, by
a general Hint upon every <i>Part</i> or <i>Section</i> of
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Book</span></em>, <i>Viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>first Part</i>, I have explain’d the History
of the <i>Formation</i> and <i>Animation</i> of Man,
together with the <i>Maturation</i>, <i>Nutrition</i>, and
<i>Position</i> of the Infant in the Womb; to which
I have subjoin’d the <i>Anatomical</i> Account of the
<i>Membranes</i> and <i>Waters</i>, as well as of the <i>After-Birth</i>
and <i>Navel-String</i>. I have likewise in
this place previously set forth the Dignity and
Excellency of <i>Man</i>, together with the Faculties
of our <i>Souls</i>, and the Qualities of our <i>Bodies</i>;
And, having initiated the whole with the
Natural Proofs of a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, and a short Dissertation
upon <i>Nature</i>, I hope none will take that
amiss, because my Belief in the <i>one</i>, and the
small Knowledge I have acquir’d of the <i>other</i>,
are to be my <i>Guide</i> throughout the Course of
my Life, as well as my <i>Directory</i> in the present
Performance.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>Second Part</i>, I have not only explain’d
the Natural <i>Philosophy</i> of the <i>Maiden-State</i>,
and set forth the Passions, as well as
the Diseases familiar to <i>Virgins</i>; but also defin’d
the Power of <i>Imagination</i>, and added the
Natural Reasons for the various <i>Likenesses</i> of
Children.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>Third</i>, I have expounded the Mystery
of <i>Conception</i>, together with its Diagnostick
Signs: I have directed the <i>Regimen</i> of the
Pregnant Woman, and particularly set forth
the various <i>Symptoms</i> of the Months of Gestation,
together with the <i>Acute Diseases</i> incident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>to her in that Time. I have in the same
place insisted at Large upon <i>Miscarriage</i>, and
explain’d at length the <i>Mystical Theory</i> of
Birth in general.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>Fourth Section</i>, I have defin’d the
<i>Art of Midwifery</i>, and the Contemplation of
its <i>Theoretical</i>, as well as its <i>Practical</i> Knowledge:
And, that <i>Women</i> practising this <i>Art</i>,
may not mistake me in what is said or recommended
to them, I have also addressed my self
to <i>Men</i> professing the same <i>Science</i>; and, with
all imaginable Impartiality, told them both
their <i>Faults</i> and their <i>Duties</i>, however without
any intended particular <i>Reflection</i>. To
which I have subjoin’d a compleat <i>Anatomical
Description</i> of the Parts of <i>Generation</i> proper
to Women; together with the Natural History
of the <i>Matrix</i> and its amazing Faculties.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>Fifth</i>, I have ingenuously laid open the
whole Mystery of <i>Midwifery</i>, as to all Sorts of
<span class='sc'>Births</span>, whether <i>Natural</i> or <i>Preternatural</i>, and
faithfully laid down the Fundamental Principles
and most certain Rules of this <i>Profession</i>; and
that not only according to the best <i>Notions</i> of
my own Application and Study, or the real
<i>Dictates</i> of my proper Practice and Experience;
but also according to the most ingenious
Precepts and infallible <i>Maxims</i> of the
ablest and most polite <i>Professors</i> of this excellent
<i>Art</i>, and that also according to its newest
and latest <i>Improvements</i>: And in these <i>Cases</i>,
I have neither fear’d the Invectives of the Æmulous
<i>Zoilus</i>, nor regarded the Snarlings of
the reprehensive <i>Momus</i>: For Wise Men are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>not any longer to be entertained with <i>Ænigmas</i>,
since <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> hath said, <i>Fiat Lux</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>Sixth Part</i>, I have not only prescrib’d
the due <i>Regimen</i>, and provided for the
Safety and happy <i>Recovery</i> of the <i>Child-Bed-Woman</i>,
but also taken a suitable and corresponding
Care of her <i>Babe</i>; As I have farther
instilled particularly upon the various Disasters
incident to both <i>Mother</i> and <i>Child</i>, in their
respective tender Conditions of <i>Child-Bed</i> and
<i>Infancy</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>Seventh</i>, I have dilucidated the <i>Philosophical
History</i> of all the different Sorts of
<i>Preternatural Conceptions</i> as well as <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Births</span></em>;
and insisted at large upon the Theme of Women’s
<i>Sterility</i> or <i>Barrenness</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>Eighth</i> and last <i>Section</i>, I have not
only defin’d the <i>Widow-State</i>, as far as it concern’d
my Purpose, but also diligently pursued
the <i>Subject-Matter</i>, and traced down the Particulars
of their common <i>Grievances</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em>, I say, are the general Heads of
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Work</span></em>, which are all again sub-divided into
their proper respective Particulars; and consequently
every general <i>Head</i> or <i>Section</i> assign’d
its own relative <i>Chapters</i>, for the singular Benefit
and more easy Comprehension of the
<i>Reader</i>. And these <i>Chapters</i> consisting of 130
in Number, I have, with respect to every singular
<i>Distemper</i> mentioned in them, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>First</span></em>,
defin’d the Nature of the <i>Disease</i>; <span class='sc'>Secondly</span>,
accounted for its <i>Causes</i>; <span class='sc'>Thirdly</span>, I have
given the <i>Diagnostick Signs</i> or <i>Symptoms</i>;
<span class='sc'>Fourthly</span>, the <i>Prognosticks</i> or Degrees of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>Danger; to which I have <span class='sc'>Fifthly</span> and lastly
added the Method of <i>Prevention</i> in many
Cases, and That of <span class='sc'>Cure</span> in All: So that
there is almost not one <i>Disease</i> which can
affect the Woman from her <i>Birth</i> to her <i>Death</i>,
in <i>Child</i>, <i>Maiden</i>, <i>Wife</i>, or <i>Widow-hood</i>, whose
<i>Essence</i>, <i>Species</i>, <i>Differences</i>, <i>Causes</i>, <i>Signs</i>,
and <i>Prognosticks</i>, we have not sufficiently
clear’d up.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> these Things I have endeavour’d to
be most particular in, to the end that any
<i>Woman</i>, who reads, so as to be conversant
with this <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Book</span></em>, may know before She sends
for her <i>Physician</i>, not only her <i>Distemper</i>,
but also the <i>Danger</i>, with which she is threatned
upon every Sickly occasion. And in these
Things I flatter my self that this <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Work</span></em>
will prove Acceptable, where such a Number
of <i>Diseases</i> and <i>Symptoms</i> are set forth in so
clear a Light, that any Person, making use of
their Eyes and Reason only, without being
any ways vers’d in the Practice of <i>Physick</i>, or
<i>Midwifery</i>, may evidently see, perceive, and
by Experience find, every individual <i>Case</i> to
answer these Ends, and the whole to correspond
exactly with its <i>Title</i> and <i>Contents</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> upon the whole, if here and there a
brief <i>Philosophical</i> way of Reasoning has
crept in, I would have you consider, that it
could not be avoided; because the <i>Proofs</i> relating
to Natural Things are sometimes taken
from very minute <i>Instruments</i>; And that the
Design of such an <i>Interspersion</i>, is only to assist
your Understanding, and conduct your Thoughts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>through the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Work</span></em>. However in such <i>Cases</i>
the <i>Reader</i> may go on, or pass by what does
not suit with his <i>Taste</i>, as he pleases. Again
if here and there, I have retain’d a <i>Term of Art</i>,
which the common <i>Reader</i> may call a hard
Word, I declare it is out of no Design to amuse
any one, but out of mere Necessity, since otherways
I should have been ridiculously singular,
and far less understood: In the mean time I
have taken what Care I could to explain the
most, or at least the most requisite of <i>These</i>, insomuch
that whatever <i>Words</i> or <i>Sentences</i> of
this Kind are not fully interpreted, you may
slip over, without losing any thing Material of
the Purport of the Matter, such Things concerning
the <i>Practitioner</i> more than the
common <i>Reader</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet, if the Measures I have
pursued in handling this uncultivated <i>Subject</i>,
should not appear so exactly Methodical as
some of you may expect, I shall only say for
<i>Excuse</i>, that, as it belongs to hard Labour to
cut out new Paths and Ways thro’ <i>Woods</i> and
<i>Desarts</i>, and where <i>Guides</i> are wanting, to
find out the shortest <i>Cut</i>; so it is only by frequent
<i>Travelling</i>, that such <i>Roads</i> can become
smooth and easy, however exactly plan’d. Again
farther, I would have you also to consider
the Difficulty of the <i>Task</i>, to contract
Much in a Little; to omit Nothing which ought
to be animadverted; to join Perspicuity with
Brevity; and after all, finally to reduce the
whole to the certain <i>Precepts</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Art</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>I have incessantly perus’d the vast <i>Volumes</i> of
others, <i>Ancients</i> as well as <i>Moderns</i>; and whatever
may be found there variously dispers’d,
over-strain’d, or collected profusely, without
either Order, or Coherence, you’ll find here manifestly
disposed, and neatly contracted in this
small <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Work</span></em>. I have sever’d the <i>Grain</i> from
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Chaff</span></em>, winnowed the <i>Seeds</i> from the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Husks</span></em>, and purged the <i>Gold</i> from the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Ore</span></em>,
to the end that I might again successfully <i>Sow</i>
what I have thus laboriously <i>reaped</i>; and digest
all Things into such an easy and clear <i>Method</i>,
that you’ll be at no Loss here for what you want,
but may turn to it at once, whatever the <i>Case</i>
may be; you’ll read nothing twice, nor will
you fall into any <i>Trifles</i>, which might either
confuse, or detain you.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> that I may not be misconstrued or
misrepresented here, give me Leave to affirm
that the Design of this <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Work</span></em>, is not to reprehend
or find Fault, with any former <i>Writer’s
Performance</i>; but only to render these Things,
which <i>others</i> have either treated negligently, or
indifferently, confusedly, or obscurely, the more
Clear and Evident.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em>, candid <i>Reader</i>, being the Design as
well as the Reason of my <i>Undertaking</i>, according
to the <i>Fruit</i> you receive by it, Pray,
repress the Minds of the Invidious; and according
to the Judgment you make of its Worth,
let it stand or fall in your Esteem. Not that I
am so vain in the <i>interim</i> to imagine, that the
Work can stand upon the Foot of its own
<i>Merit</i>; and far less can I expect that it will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>escape the ordinary Fate of <i>Censure</i>: No, I
shall take it well, considering its <i>Imperfections</i>,
if it undergoes no worse Fate, than what is
common to <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Books</span></em>; especially considering
that it is no ways set off with a great <i>Figure</i>,
under the splendid appearance and modish
Trappings of flourishing <i>Hypotheses</i>, so common
among our <i>Modern Writers</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THERE</em> are many Things altogether
New in our <i>Midwifery</i>, which I would have
none rashly to stumble at, tho’ I know that <i>New
Opinions</i> are always suspected and generally
opposed, merely because they are not already
<i>Common</i>: But as I am not in any respect to
press my <i>Notion</i> of Things upon the Belief of
<i>others</i>, so I desire not to establish any <i>Maxims</i>
of mine in other Peoples <i>Opinions</i>, farther than
they think fit. I know the Relish of the <i>Understanding</i>,
is often as different as that of the
<i>Palate</i>; Hence it is that <i>some</i> Men condemn,
what <i>others</i> approve; and <i>some</i> despise what <i>others</i>
admire: Yea such is the Uncertainty of
Men’s <i>Judgments</i>, concerning the Excellency
of Things, that no <i>Nut</i> of Learning was ever
yet open’d, whose <i>Contents</i> were allowed by all
to be pure <i>Kernel</i>: And no more has any
<i>Truth</i> been yet discover’d, either in <i>Physick</i> or
<i>Midwifery</i>, which has not been question’d, and
the <i>Detector</i> exclaim’d against as a pedantick
<i>Innovator</i>: But all that I shall say to these
<i>Things</i> is, that, as <i>Antiquity</i> will never protect
an <i>Error</i> in Judgment, so <i>Novelty</i> shall never
prejudice me against <span class='sc'>Truth</span>, whether of my
own or other People’s <i>Invention</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> the whole, I would in fine recommend
my self to the candid <i>Reader</i>’s Benevolent
and Charitable Opinion, and if in any particular
Point or Respect (because we are but
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Men</span></em>) I may not have had the Happiness to
please, or to give Satisfaction, Pray impute it
not to <i>Sloth</i> or <i>Idleness</i>, but to <i>Peregrination</i>
and <i>Travelling</i>; in which it may be well suppos’d
that <i>Studies</i> are too often interrupted.
Remember also <i>that</i> of <i>Pliny</i>, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">haud ullo
in genere veniam Justiorem esse, si modò
mirum non est, Hominem Genitum non
omnia Humana novisse</span></i>.” For as none of us
can do all Things, nor is sufficient for All; so it
is Natural for <i>Man</i> to fall, to err, and to be
deceiv’d: And as we see some <i>Blemishes</i> in the
most beautiful <i>Bodies</i>, so there is nothing altogether
<i>Perfect</i>, among the Works of Men.</p>

<em class='gesperrt'>REASON</em>, and the mere Contemplation
of <i>Nature</i> (abstracted from the
Light and Assistance of <i>Revelation</i> or
<i>Faith</i>) afford us sufficient convincing
Arguments, for the <i>Existence</i> of this
great and incomprehensible <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Being</span></em>; as
<i>Heathens</i> themselves do testify.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ACCORDING</em> to <i>Plato</i> (that most excellent
Heathenish <i>Divine</i>) Philosophical Demonstrations are the
only <i>Catharticks</i> (<i>i. e.</i> Purgers) of the <i>Soul</i>; being the
most proper means to cleanse it from <i>Error</i>, and give
us an exact Relish of Sacred <i>Truths</i>. Wherefore I
shall strictly confine myself to <i>These</i>, in proving the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Being</span></em> of this <i>Existence</i>, from the <i>Maxims</i> of all the
four principal <i>Sects</i> of Heathen Philosophers; which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>I shall discuss in the briefest <i>Terms</i>, by only touching
upon a few of their respective <i>Proofs</i>; <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Naturalist</i> insists chiefly upon three Heads;
That of <i>Motion</i>, the <i>Final</i>, and the <i>Efficient Cause</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> the Axiom of <i>Motion</i>, that <i>Sect</i> could not
exceed, or go beyond the <i>Primum Mobile</i> among <i>created
Beings</i>; and therefore allows, that there is something
<i>above</i> it, which moves <i>itself</i> and is not moved by <i>Another</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> that of the <i>Final Cause</i>, they could find no
<i>created Being</i> capable of directing that <i>Nature</i>, which directs
and appoints all <i>Creatures</i> to aim at some peculiar
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>End</span></em>; and thence conclude, that this <i>Nature</i> is directed
by something <i>superior</i> to itself.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> that of the <i>Efficient Cause</i>, they confess, from
the many Vicissitudes of <i>created Beings</i>, that they’ve all
had a <i>Beginning</i>: and (because no <i>Beginning</i> can be
without an <i>Efficient</i>) acknowledge, that <i>something</i> more
excellent than all <i>created Beings</i>, hath created them.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Metaphysician</i> useth a vast Variety of sublime
<i>Arguments</i>; whereof I shall only give a few Instances: <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> every <i>finite Being</i> must needs proceed
from <i>something</i> else, limiting it in that <i>Finiteness</i>, in
which its <i>Nature</i> conflicts.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> all <i>Multitude</i> must proceed from <i>Unity</i>,
as the <i>Motions</i> of the <i>lower Orbs</i> proceed from that of the
<i>one highest</i>; or as the many particular distinct <i>Actions</i>
and different <i>Motions</i> of the Man, proceed from (their
<i>Superior</i>) the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Soul</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> the <i>Subordination</i> of the <i>Creatures</i>, one
serving another, and all concurring to the <i>Common Good</i>,
must needs proceed from the <i>Disposal</i> of some most wise
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Governour</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> the wonderful and incomparable <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Art</span></em>,
observable in the <i>Make</i> and <i>Form</i> of every the minutest
Part of the least and most despicable <i>Creature</i>, must
necessarily proceed from some very great and omnipotent
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Artificer</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Sect</i> acknowledges also the <i>Immortality</i> of
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Soul</span></em>, as <i>Cicero</i> witnesses; because it is an <i>immaterial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Substance</i>, and independent of the <i>Body</i>: And consequently
they allow it to proceed from an <i>immortal
Author</i>, and to return to the <i>same</i>, after a <i>Dissolution</i> from
the Body.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the <i>Moralist</i>, his way of <i>Reasoning</i> is plainer
to our common Capacities.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> proves this <i>Argument</i> from the <i>natural Disposition</i>
and <i>Propensity</i> of the worst of Men, even <i>Atheists</i>
themselves, upon the Approach of Death or any heavy
<i>Calamity</i>, to acknowledge some superior divine
Power; as <i>Seneca</i> witnesseth of <i>Caligula</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> the <i>ultimate End</i> and chief <i>Good</i> of Man;
which (according to <i>Plato</i>) is nothing <i>Terrestrial</i>: Our
<i>Souls</i> being <i>insatiable</i> in this Life, have a constant
<i>Tendency</i> to that particular <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>End</span></em>, for which we are
<i>created</i>; which (in his Words) consists only in being
<i>inseparably</i> united to <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> <i>Virtue</i> and <i>Vice</i>, the <i>Rewards</i> and <i>Punishments</i>
due to these from <i>Nature</i> and <i>Reason</i>; which agree
with <i>Equity</i> and <i>Justice</i>, that they, who <i>live well</i>, should
be <i>rewarded</i> with this their <i>ultimate End</i> and <i>final Felicity</i>:
And those who live <i>otherwise</i>, should be <i>punished</i> by
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Loss</span></em> thereof forever. Thence they (of consequence)
acknowledge, that there must be a just and
powerful <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Judge</span></em>, above all <i>created Beings</i>, to inflict
this impartial <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Sentence</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Mathematician</i> acknowledges <i>That</i> to be some
<i>Being superior</i> to all others; whose <i>Center</i> he finds every
where, and whose <i>Circumference</i> he can limit or discover
no where. But because this <i>Sect</i> borrows the better
Part of their <i>Proofs</i> from the other <i>three</i> mentioned, I
shall go no farther; designing nothing but <i>Brevity</i> thro’out
this Work, especially upon a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Thesis</span></em> so manifest
as <i>This</i>: Which indeed I should not so much as have
touched upon, considering how elegantly and copiously
many very <i>learned Divines</i>, and other eminent <i>Writers</i>,
have treated that <i>Subject</i>; were it not that some subsequent
<i>Hypotheses</i> depend immediately upon it. Wherefore
I proceed to</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> II.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>NATURE</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> <i>extensive</i> this Word <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Nature</span></em> may
be, and whatever secundary <i>Definitions</i> it may
admit of; it is (in effect) nothing else than the <i>Denouncer</i>
of the Divine Will and Pleasure, the <i>Efficient</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Cause</span></em>
of natural <i>Works</i>, and the <i>Conservant</i> of real <i>Existences</i>:
Or, the <i>Order</i> and <i>Series</i> of Sacred Works, obeying the
Divine Will, Power, and Commands. At least I think
all other <i>Definitions</i> of this Word, taken in whatsoever
Sense, may be <i>reduced</i> to <i>These</i> following; <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c016'><em class='gesperrt'><i>NATURE</i></em> is the implanted and <i>innate Quality</i> of
Things.</p>

<p class='c016'><em class='gesperrt'><i>NATURE</i></em> is the <i>Faculty</i> and <i>Propensity</i> of every
Mind.</p>

<p class='c016'><em class='gesperrt'><i>NATURE</i></em> is the <i>Mixture</i> and <i>Temperature</i> of the
four Elements.</p>

<p class='c016'><em class='gesperrt'><i>NATURE</i></em> is the Philosopher’s <i>Axiom</i> of Motion
and Rest.</p>

<p class='c016'><em class='gesperrt'><i>NATURE</i></em> is <i>that</i> which giveth <i>Form</i>, by a specifick
Difference, to every thing.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> <i>Power</i> (in either Definition) can only be
ascribed to that Great <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, whose <i>infinite Existence</i>
I’ve been hinting upon: Who is the <i>Author</i> of Nature
and <i>Framer</i> of the Universe; who by his own <i>Breath</i>
and <i>Word</i>, without any <i>material Help</i>, and at his own
<i>Will</i> and <i>Pleasure</i>, created all Things. In whom all
Things <i>live</i>, <i>move</i>, and have their <i>Being</i>. By whom a
vivacious <i>Faculty</i> is infused through all Things; so as
that (by and through <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Him</span></em>) all Things subsist of their
own <i>peculiar Natures</i> and <i>natural Qualities</i>; and by these
<i>implanted Qualities</i> increase, maintain, and defend themselves:
And <i>that</i> so, that in such an immense <i>University</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>and such a vast <i>Variety</i> of Things, nothing is indeed
<i>idle</i>, <i>useless</i>, or <i>unprofitable</i>. Nothing is made <i>rashly</i>, <i>fortuitously</i>,
or <i>in vain</i>; but every Thing appears appointed
to some certain <i>Use</i> and <i>Purpose</i>, and determined to
some settled <i>Course</i> and <i>Sphere</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Action</span></em>: Every <i>Being</i>
answering the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>End</span></em> of its <i>Design</i>, and the <i>Design</i> of its
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Creation</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> <i>Man</i> was set on the <i>Theatre</i> of this World, to
the <i>End</i> that he might admire, delight, and confide in
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> his great <i>Creator</i>; so was the <i>Humane Body</i> made
for the <i>Divine Soul</i>, and the <i>respective Members</i> for the
<i>Body</i>: which all voluntarily concur in the Discharge of
their <i>peculiar Functions</i>, for the Benefit and Use of the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Whole</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> so was every <i>Stem</i> endued with its own <i>Faculty</i>,
and every <i>Creature</i> with its own <i>Nature</i>; which
made <i>Aristotle</i><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> most pertinently say, “<i>That there’s nothing
so minute in the Nature of Things, nothing so abject
or despicable, but may reasonably afford Men something
of Admiration.</i>”</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em>, I think, we may be soon brought to this <i>Admiration</i>,
when we only <i>view</i> those Things which are
so evidently exposed to our Eyes: such as the <i>Elements</i>,
the <i>Heavens</i>, the <i>Rising</i> and <i>Setting</i> of the <i>Sun</i>, <i>Moon</i>,
and <i>Stars</i>, the <i>Diurnal</i> and <i>Nocturnal Vicissitudes</i>, the <i>four
Seasons</i> of the Year, comprehending the two <i>Æquinoctials</i>
of Spring and Fall, and the two <i>Solstices</i> of Summer
and Winter; by whose <i>Decourse</i> or Descent <i>Grass</i>
fades, and <i>Herbs</i> decay; and again, by their Ascent or
<i>Influence</i>, spring up and revive.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> again, when we consider the <i>Animals</i>, the <i>Faculties</i>
and <i>Propension</i> of their respective <i>Natures</i>, how they are
endued with peculiar <i>Sense</i>, because denied particular <i>Reason</i>;
and how wisely they are all dispos’d, some inhabiting
the <i>Waters</i>, some enjoying the free <i>Air</i>, and others possessing
the <i>Desarts</i>; some <i>reptile</i> and creeping, some <i>gradient</i>
and walking, some <i>solivagant</i> and wandering, some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span><i>wild</i> and fierce, and others innocent and <i>tame</i>: I say
the marvellous and inimitable <i>Artifice</i> of <i>Nature</i> in these,
and all other <i>natural Works</i>, is not only to be admir’d;
but also the <i>Majesty</i>, <i>Glory</i>, <i>Fullness</i>, and <i>Magnificence</i> of
the Great <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Creator</span></em> and Institutor of this Nature is
to be most highly ador’d; in whom all things originally
<i>center</i>, as their common <i>Source</i> and Divine <i>Fountain</i>, and
to whom all things are finally <i>reduced</i>, as the Primigenious
<i>Essence</i> and <i>Archetype</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Nature</span></em>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> III.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>MAN</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>MAN</em>, to whom all <i>sublunary Beings</i> were subjected,
is most excellently qualified, far above all other
<i>Creatures</i> of this World: In him is not only the
vegetative Life of <i>Plants</i>, and the sensitive Life of <i>Animals</i>,
but also the <i>Angelical Reason</i>, the Divine <i>Understanding</i>,
the true <i>Conjunction</i> and glorious <i>Possession</i> of all
Things: He is not only endued with <i>Reason</i> and the
<i>Gift of Speaking</i>, but also with a <i>Mind</i> and a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Soul</span></em>,
which participates of a <i>Celestial Nature</i> and <i>Divinity</i> itself;
which can relate to the Nature of nothing else, and
be compared to none but <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> himself: In and thro’
<i>whom</i> he has a <i>Similitude</i> with all things, an <i>Operation</i>
with all, and <i>Conversation</i> with all: He symbolizeth
with all Matters in proper <i>Subjects</i>; with the
<i>Elements</i> in a fourfold Body; with <i>Plants</i> in a vegetative
Virtue; with <i>Animals</i> in a sensitive Faculty; with
the <i>Heavens</i> in an Etherial Spirit; with <i>Angels</i> in Wisdom
and Understanding, and with <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> himself (as it
were) in containing and comprehending all things, except
the Divine Being. Hence nothing can so expresly represent
<span class='sc'>God</span> as the <i>Soul</i> of Man, by which he is dignified and
railed to the very <i>Image</i> and <i>Similitude</i> of himself. And in
<i>MAN</i> the mirificent <i>Wisdom</i> shines the more conspicuously;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>in that the whole <i>World</i>, and the <i>Fabrick</i> of all its
Contents, however concise and artificial, can in no respect
compare with the noble Structure of this <i>Microcosm</i>,
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Man</span></em>. It is so marvellously concise, and so wonderfully
artificial, that it seems no otherways, than as if the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Maker</span></em> (designing <i>this</i> for his <i>Master-piece</i>) would have
his chief Glory, Esteem, and Reputation to depend
upon it, and derive itself from <i>Hence</i>; or, as if the <i>Maker</i>
(designing this for one signal Instance of his <i>Divinity</i>
to Men) would have us brought, merely by the
Understanding and Knowledge of ourselves, to the true
<i>Knowledge</i> and due <i>Reverence</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Himself</span></em>, our great
<i>ARTIFICER</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> we may be the more duly and sensibly affected
towards <i>him</i>, and the more admire and reverence
the <i>Wisdom</i> of his Nature, as he bountifully produced
all things for the Use and Utility of <i>MAN</i>; so he most
appositely disposed the <i>Herbs</i> of the Field, some to our
<i>Nourishment</i>, some to our <i>Remedies</i>, and some to <i>both Necessities</i>:
assimilating and assigning them to our singular
<i>Members</i>, so that their <i>Powers</i> and <i>Virtues</i> are <i>physically</i>
convey’d to such <i>Parts</i> of our <i>Bodies</i>, as they are adapted
to by <i>Nature</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> in the same manner he imbued the <i>Roots</i> of
the Ground with such <i>natural Qualities</i>, that they by
their respective innate <i>Faculties</i>, succour and relieve
those <i>Members</i>, to which they are <i>specifically</i> destinated;
and such <i>Members</i> sensibly attract and imbibe from them,
not only wholesome <i>Nutriment</i>, but also healthful <i>Remedies</i>
peculiarly appropriated to themselves by <i>Nature</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> the immortal <i>SOUL</i>, which is only peculiar to
<i>MAN</i>, whereby he so perfectly assimilates and resembles
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>; and its <i>Gifts</i> and <i>Graces</i>, whereby he excels and
out-shines all other sublunary <i>Creatures</i>; is more properly
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Subject</span></em> of the <i>Divine</i>, than the <i>Physician</i>; wherefore
I shall but touch it transiently.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> IV.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>SOUL</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE <i>SOUL</i></em> is a certain <i>divine Light</i>, created after
the Image of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>; figured by a <i>Seal</i>, whose
Character is the <i>eternal Word</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>SOUL</i> is a certain <i>divine Substance</i>, individual,
and entirely present in <i>every Part</i> of the Body, depending
only upon the Power of <i>Him</i>, who is the ultimate
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>End</span></em>, and efficient <i>Cause</i> of all things; whose <i>Body</i> (according
to <i>Plato</i>) is <i>Truth</i>, whose <i>Shadow</i> is <i>Light</i>, and
whose <i>Name</i> is <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> this divine Substance of <i>Light</i>, the <i>SOUL</i>, immediately
proceeding from that divine Fountain of all
Things, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, (according to the Opinion of the <i>Platonists</i>)
is join’d, by competent <i>Means</i>, to the grosser
Matter of the <i>Body</i>. Which <i>Means</i> these <i>Heathens</i> account
for in manner following: <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>SOUL</i>, in its Descent, is involved in an <i>etherial
Body</i>, which they call the <i>celestial Vehicle</i>, or <i>Chariot</i> of
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Soul</span></em>; thro’ which <i>Medium</i>, by the Command of
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, (who is the <i>Center</i> of the World) it is first <i>infus’d</i>
into the middle <i>Punct</i> of the <i>Heart</i>, which is the
<i>Center</i> of the <i>Body</i>; whence it is <i>diffus’d</i> thro’ all the
Parts and Members of the <i>Body</i>, joining itself to the
<i>natural Heat</i>. As a <i>Spirit</i>, generated by <i>Heat</i> from the
<i>Heart</i>, it plungeth itself into the <i>Humours</i>; and thus
inhering in all the respective <i>Parts</i>, it becomes equal in
degree of <i>Proximity</i> to all the <i>Members</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> the immortal <i>SOUL</i> is, by an immortal <i>Engine</i>,
convey’d to, and included in the mortal <i>Body</i>: But
when by <i>Diseases</i>, or otherways, these <i>Mediums</i> (the
<i>Heat</i> and <i>Humours</i>) begin to dissolve, the <i>Soul</i> recollects
itself, and flies back betimes to its first <i>Receptacle</i>, the
<i>Heart</i>: When the <i>Spirit</i> of the <i>Heart</i> also fails, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><i>Heat</i> extinguishes, and the <i>Spirit</i> leaves the <i>Man</i>; He
dies, and the <em class='gesperrt'><i>SOUL</i></em> flies away in its <i>original Vehicle</i>:
When the <i>Body</i> returns to Earth, whence it came, and
the <i>Spirit</i> to <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>God</em></span>, who gave it a <i>sacred Nature</i> and
<i>divine Offspring</i>: which <i>Spirit</i> judging the <i>SOUL</i>, if it has
liv’d ill, subjects it to some general and some particular
<i>Torments of Hell</i>, abandoning it also to the Pleasure
of the <i>Devil</i>: Whereas, if it has <i>done well</i>, it mounts its
<i>celestial Chariot</i>, rejoicing together with the <i>Spirit</i>, and
passes freely to the Choirs of <i>Heaven</i>; where it enjoys
all its pure <i>Senses</i> and <i>Faculties</i>, the perfect <i>Knowledge</i> of
all things, a perpetual blessed <i>Felicity</i>; and at last, the
divine <i>Vision</i>, the <i>Possession</i> of the eternal Kingdom, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> far I have prosecuted the <i>Platonick Doctrine</i>
of the <i>SOUL</i>; so that even by <i>This</i>, the gross Opinion of
such as deny the <i>Existence</i> of so <i>divine</i> a <span class='sc'>Spark</span> in Man,
may be confuted.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> <i>this</i> being sufficient for that purpose, I need
not introduce any <i>Christian Arguments</i> to second it;
which, however important, are commonly deem’d light
by an obstinate <i>Sett</i> of Men. Wherefore I shall only
add, that from the Disparity of <i>Manners</i>, <i>Affections</i>,
<i>Dispositions</i>, <i>Capacities</i>, <i>Judgments</i>, <i>Opinions</i>, and <i>Passions</i>
of Men, it appears most probable and evident, that
every <i>one of us</i> is individually indued with a <span class='sc'>Soul</span>, and
that with a proper <span class='sc'>Soul</span>, peculiar to our respective
<i>Bodies</i>, according to the wise <i>Proverb; So many Men, so
many Minds</i>: as well as <i>Horace</i>’s<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Saying,</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>TO</em> which Assertion the great Prophet <i>David</i> assents,
in that <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>God</em></span> fashioned and made the <i>Hearts</i> and <i>Minds</i>
of Men one by one, enduing them with peculiar <i>Dispositions</i>,
and assigning every <span class='sc'>Soul</span> its proper natural <i>Conditions</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Hence <i>Solomon</i><a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a> says, <i>I was a witty Child, and
had a good Spirit; yea, rather being good, I came into a
Body undefiled</i>: That is, adapted to the <i>Disposition</i> of
his <i>SOUL</i>. As we see some <i>Torches</i> or <i>Candles</i> burn
brighter, and some <i>Fuel</i> cast more <i>Heat</i> and <i>Light</i> than
others; so the <i>Splendour</i> of every <i>SOUL</i> shines in a different
way, and produces different <i>Distinctions</i> of <i>Minds</i>:
as is evident in <i>Youths</i>, who (however accurately taught,
and painfully instructed) are not equally capable of
learning <i>Arts</i>, <i>Discipline</i>, or any sort of <i>Erudition</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> notwithstanding that some curious <i>Physicians</i>
(who have strictly scrutiniz’d the Works of Nature)
would have the <i>SOUL</i> to center in the <span class='sc'>Brain</span>, whence all
its <i>Senses</i>, <i>Faculties</i>, and <i>Actions</i> proceed; yet some <i>Philosophers</i>
have justly assign’d the <i>Center</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Heart</em></span>
to its Residence: which Doctrine is also approved by
the wise <i>Solomon</i><a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a>, saying; <i>Keep thy Heart with all Diligence,
for out of it are the Issues of Life</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet, if any should still obstinately persist
in denying the <span class='sc'>Being</span> of the <i>SOUL</i>, I advise such to go no
farther, but look into <i>themselves</i>, and call their own <i>Minds</i>
to Counsel; for even there they will have a full <i>View</i>, not
only of its <span class='sc'>Being</span>, but also of its supernatural <i>Excellency</i>;
If they but seriously weigh the eximious <i>Gifts</i>, and
unlimited <i>Faculties</i> of <i>Nature</i>, together with the egregious
<i>Ornaments</i> of <i>Reason</i>, <i>Understanding</i>, <i>Judgment</i>, <i>Memory</i>,
and many other Accomplishments, with which
every <i>Mind</i> is abundantly endued; they will clearly perceive
something of a superexcellent <i>Nature</i>, and Supernatural
<i>Quality</i> in themselves; which is nothing else but
what I call the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Soul</em></span>, and which is also of a more noble
and excelling <i>Substance</i>, than any <i>corporeal Matter</i>
liable to <i>Corruption</i> can be.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Being</i>, only and alone, vivifies, rules, and
governs the <i>Body</i>; furnishing it with innumerable <i>Actions</i>,
and exercising it with as many curious <i>Offices</i>.
Hence, from its manifold <i>Effects</i>, and different <i>Operations</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>it has various <i>Appellations</i>, according to St. <i>Augustine</i>’s
Saying: “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cùm Corpus animat, Vitâq; imbuit,
Anima dicitur: Dum vult, Animus: dum Scientiâ ornata
est, ac Judicandi peritiam exercet, Mens: dum recolit
ac reminiscitur, Memoria: dum ratiocinatur, ac singula
discernit, Ratio: dum Contemplationi insistit, Spiritus:
dum Sentiendi vim obtinet, Sensus.</span></i>” Which are all
the principal <i>Functions</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Soul</em></span>, whereby it demonstrates
its <i>Power</i>, and performs its relative <i>Offices</i>.
In the Execution whereof, St. <i>Cyprian</i> asserts, that the
<i>SOUL</i> makes use of the <i>Body</i>, as the <i>Workman</i> does of
the <i>Mallet</i>, <i>Hatchet</i>, or <i>Anvil</i>: tho’ (I think) the <i>Simile</i>
may be drawn much nearer, the <i>SOUL</i> being inclosed
and dwelling in the <i>Body</i>, as the <i>Fish</i> or the <i>Snail</i> in the
<i>Shell</i>; without which <i>Receptacle</i>, or <i>Rampart</i> of Defence,
it cannot subsist: Which is evident in that, as soon as the
<i>Body</i> labours under any <i>Grief</i>, the <i>SOUL</i> is also affected;
not with a primary <i>Affection</i> (as some would have it) but
by a <i>Law</i> of the most strict <i>Alliance</i>, and nearest <i>Affinity</i>;
and hence it is, that the <i>Vices</i> and <i>Virtues</i> of the <i>one</i> are
transfus’d, and flow into the <i>other</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> is the only reason why, when the <i>corporeal
Organs</i> or <i>Instruments</i> are vitiated or impeded, the <i>SOUL</i>
cannot explicate its own <i>Faculties</i>, according to the
Words of <i>Solomon</i><a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a>; <i>The corruptible Body presseth down
the Soul, and the earthly Tabernacle weigheth down the Mind</i>.
Which <i>Truth</i> may serve to obviate two Objections; <i>viz.</i>
<i>That</i> of <i>Childrens</i> being destitute of the <i>SOUL</i>, and <i>that</i>
of the <i>SOUL</i>’s growing up with <i>Youth</i>, and declining
with <i>Age</i>, or <i>Sickness</i>: Since, tho’ it less displays itself in
<i>Infancy</i>, <i>Sickness</i>, and <i>Dotage</i>, yet it still is, and continues
furnished with its proper <i>Faculties</i>, and that from the
<i>Beginning</i> of Life, until its <i>End</i>; neither does the <i>SOUL</i>
in its <i>Substance</i> ever suffer the least <i>Diminution</i>, but only
by the <i>Ineptitude</i> of the Instrument or <i>Organ</i>, it may
be hindered in the <i>Discharge</i> of its Functions, and <i>Execution</i>
of its Offices.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> tho this <i>divine Substance</i> can contract nothing of
<i>Vice</i>, <i>Spot</i>, or <i>Contagion</i> from the <i>Concretion</i> of the corruptible
<i>Body</i>: yet as a thick <i>Cloud</i> obscures the <i>Sun-Beams</i>,
and overcasts its <i>Light</i>; or, as by holding a <i>versicolour
Glass</i> to our Eyes, Matters appear <i>different</i> from what they
really are: So the <i>Intemperature</i> of the <i>Body</i> obscures the
<i>Light</i> of <i>Reason</i>, and overshadows the <i>Intellects</i> of the <i>Mind</i>,
which of course obstructs the <i>Functions</i> of the <span class='sc'>Soul</span>.
Hence it is, that a <i>delirious</i> or <i>drunken</i> Man thinks he sees
double, or <i>two things</i>, tho’ <i>one</i> be the only <i>Object</i> of his
Eyes: And as, for this reason, <i>melancholick</i> Persons imagine
<i>Absurdities</i>, and feign <i>Dreams</i> to themselves; so <i>cholerick</i>
Persons grow insensibly <i>hot</i>, and are suddenly <i>incensed</i>
by the Fumes of <i>noxious Humours</i> oppressing the
<i>Brain</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> there is another <i>Sett</i> of Miscreants, who don’t
so much deny the <i>Existence</i>, as the <i>Immortality</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Soul</span>. This I esteem a Piece of the grossest <i>Impiety</i>, to
think <i>that</i> spiritual Substance <i>Mortal</i> and <i>Frail</i>, which is
inspir’d in <i>Man</i> by the Divine <i>Will</i> and <i>Command</i>, proceeding
immediately from the very Substance of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>
himself: Since if Man be made after the <i>Image</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>,
to express his <i>Similitude</i>, he must needs participate of
his <i>Nature</i>, and consequently be a <i>Fellow-Sharer</i> of Eternity:
And if the <i>human</i> <span class='sc'>Soul</span> be Partaker of the divine
<i>Essence</i> or <i>Substance</i>, as <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> is <i>eternal</i> and incapable
of <i>Decay</i>, so it must needs be <i>eternal</i>, and free
from all <i>Corruption</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> form’d and made all other
<i>Things</i> for the sake of <i>Man</i>, but <i>Him</i> he made for his
<i>own sake</i>, and therefore like unto <span class='sc'>Himself</span>; for which
reason, he was pleas’d to agglutinate <i>Immortality</i> to
<i>Mortality</i>, and <i>Divinity</i> to <i>Humanity</i>: By which Means,
the <i>divine</i> <span class='sc'>Nature</span> incorporates, as it were, with the
<i>human</i>, and the <i>human</i> is united to the <i>divine</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> we may clearly see how marvellously <span class='sc'>God</span>
has been affected towards us from the <i>Beginning</i>; how
much he delighted in us, and desired the entire <i>Fruition</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and full Enjoyment of our perpetual <i>Familiarity</i>, and
eternal <i>Fellowship</i>; which <i>Truth</i> <em class='gesperrt'>Christ</em><a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a> (the Wisdom
of the <i>Father</i>) confirms by his own <i>Testimony</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> such is still the great Love and Propension of
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> towards <i>Man</i>, that all Things (thro’ his <i>Grace</i>)
are communicated to <i>him</i> by his only <em class='gesperrt'><i>SON</i></em>;<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and that
more especially because we are conditional <i>Sharers</i>, equal
<i>Inheritors</i>, and <i>Joint-Heirs</i> with him, agreeable to the<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
<i>Apostles Phrase</i>; and whatever is express’d in <i>CHRIST</i>,
may also be in <i>Man</i>: Since as <i>he</i> is <i>eternal</i>, and lives for
ever, so <i>Man</i> (by his <i>Grace</i> and <i>Merits</i>) does the same;
for <i>he</i> having sufficiently bruised <i>Satan</i>’s Head, led
<i>Captivity</i> Captive, and conquer’d <i>Death</i>, rose again, and
became the <i>Prince</i> and <i>Captain</i> of so glorious a <i>VICTORY</i>,
that all <i>Men</i>, by virtue of that <i>Triumph</i>, might be raised
up again at the Last Day, and <i>that</i> to participate of
an <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Immortality</em></span> of <i>Welfare</i> or <i>Woe</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> V.</span><br /> <i>Of the</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Faculties</em></span> <i>of the <em class='gesperrt'>SOUL</em></i>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>P<i>lato</i></em>, <i>Alcinous</i>, and many other learned Men,
do agree, that the <i>heavenly Spirit’s Composition</i>, mixing
<i>Fire</i>, <i>Air</i>, <i>Earth</i>, and <i>Water</i>, made of them all, put
together, <i>one</i> <span class='sc'>Body</span>; which they subjected to the Service
of the <i>SOUL</i>, assigning the several <i>Provinces</i> of the <i>one</i>,
to the sundry <i>Faculties</i> of the <i>other</i>: To the <i>meaner</i> of
them, mean and low <i>Places</i>; as to <i>Anger</i>, the <i>Midriff</i>;
to <i>Lust</i>, the <i>Womb</i>, &amp;c: but to the more <i>noble Senses</i>, the
<i>HEAD</i>, as the <i>Tower</i> of the whole <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> they divide these <span class='sc'>Senses</span> into <i>external</i> and <i>internal</i>;
so they subdivide the <i>external Senses</i> into <i>five</i>: To which
are allotted as many proper <i>Organs</i> or <i>Subjects</i>, being so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>order’d, that they which are placed in the more eminent
<i>Parts</i> of the <i>Body</i>, have the greater Degree of <i>Purity</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> the <i>Eyes</i>, placed in the uppermost part, are the
most <i>pure</i>, and have an Affinity with the Nature of <i>Fire</i>
and <i>Light</i>. The <i>Ears</i> have the second Order of <i>Place</i>
and <i>Purity</i>, and are compar’d to the <i>Air</i>. The <i>Nostrils</i>
take the third Order, and have a middle Nature betwixt
<i>Air</i> and <i>Water</i>. Then the <i>Organ</i> of <i>Tasting</i>,
which is <i>grosser</i>, and most like to the Nature of <i>Water</i>.
And, lastly, <i>Touching</i> being diffus’d through the whole
<i>Body</i>, is compar’d to the <i>Grossness</i> of <i>Earth</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> of these, the more <i>pure SENSES</i>, are those
which perceive their <i>Objects</i> farthest off; as first <i>Seeing</i>,
then <i>Hearing</i>, then <i>Smelling</i>, which are all more pure
than <i>Taste</i>, which doth not perceive but what is <i>nigh</i>:
whereas the <i>Touch</i> perceives <i>both Ways</i>; it perceives
<i>Bodies nigh</i>: And as <i>Sight</i> discerns by the <i>Medium</i> of the
<i>Air</i>; so the <i>Touch</i> perceives, by the <i>Medium</i> of a <i>Pole</i>,
Bodies <i>hard</i>, <i>soft</i>, <i>dry</i>, <i>moist</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> this Sense of <i>Touching</i>, is common indeed to
all <i>Animals</i>: However, ’tis certain that <i>Man</i>, in this,
as well as in the Sense of <i>Tasting</i>, excels all others:
whereas, in the other <i>three</i>, he is exceeded by some
<i>Brutes</i>, as by a <i>Dog</i>, which <i>hears</i>, <i>sees</i>, and <i>smells</i> much
more acutely than <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Man</em></span>. Besides, the <i>Lynx</i>, and <i>Eagle</i>,
see more acutely than <i>Man</i>, or any other <i>Creature</i>
in the World.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the <i>interiour SENSES</i>, they are (according to
<i>Averroes</i>) divided into <i>Four</i>; whereof the <i>first</i> is called
the <i>Common Sense</i>, because it collects and perfects such
<i>Representations</i> as are drawn-in by the <i>external SENSES</i>.
The <i>second</i> is the <i>Imaginative Faculty</i>, which retains
those receiv’d <i>Representations</i>, and presents them to the
<i>third Faculty</i> of <i>internal SENSE</i>; which is call’d the <i>Cogitative
Faculty</i>, <i>Phantasy</i>, or <i>Power</i> of <i>Judging</i>: Because it
perceives and judges by the <i>Representations</i> received,
what Nature or Kind of Thing that is, of which the
<i>Representations</i> are made; and commits those <i>Things</i> thus
discerned and adjudged, to the <i>fourth Faculty</i> of <i>Inward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>SENSE</i>, the <i>Memory</i>, to be kept there, and retain’d
by it.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> these <i>Four SENSES</i> have their respective <i>Organs</i>
in the <i>Head</i>: <i>Common Sense</i> and <i>Imagination</i> possess the
two former <i>Cells</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Brain</span></em>, as the <i>Cogitative Faculty</i>
doth the highest, and middle Part of the <i>Head</i>; the
<i>Memory</i> taking up the hindmost Part thereof.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Organs</i> of <span class='sc'>Speech</span> and <span class='sc'>Voice</span> are as many as
the inward <i>Muscles</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Thorax</span></em>, betwixt the <i>Ribs</i>,
<i>Breasts</i>, <i>Lungs</i>, <i>Arteries</i>, <i>Wind-pipe</i>, the Bending of the
<i>Tongue</i>, and all Parts and <i>Muscles</i>, serving for Respiration,
or Breathing: But the proper and immediate <i>Organ</i>
of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Speech</span></em>, is the <i>Mouth</i>, in which are fram’d
<i>Words</i> and <i>Sentences</i>, by the <i>Tongue</i>, <i>Teeth</i>, <i>Palate</i>, <i>Lips</i>,
&amp;c. above the <i>sensitive</i> <span class='sc'>Soul</span>, which expresseth its <i>Powers</i>
by the <i>Organs</i> of the Body. The <i>incorporeal Mind</i> possesseth
the highest Place, and hath a <i>double Nature</i>; the
<i>one</i> called the <i>Contemplative</i>, the <i>other</i> the <i>Active Intellect</i>,
because of their respective <i>Faculties</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ACCORDING</em> to the <i>three-fold Order</i> of its Faculties
there are <i>three APPETITES</i> in the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Soul</span></em>. The <i>first</i>
is <i>natural</i>, which is an Inclination of Nature unto
its End. The <i>second</i> is <i>Animal</i>, which is divided into
<i>irascible</i> and <i>concupiscible</i>, relating to <i>Anger</i> and <i>Desire</i>.
The <i>third</i> is <i>intellective</i>, and is call’d the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Will</em></span>;
which (from its own deprav’d Quality) is affected with
<i>four PASSIONS</i>, as the <i>Body</i> sometimes also is. The <i>first</i>
is called <i>Oblectation</i>; the <i>second</i>, <i>Effusion</i>; the <i>third</i>, <i>Ostentation</i>;
the <i>fourth</i>, and last, is what we commonly call
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Envy</span></em>. And</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>four PASSIONS</i> arising from a deprav’d <i>APPETITE</i>
of <i>Pleasure</i>; its <i>Grief</i> or <i>Perplexity</i> doth occasion
as many contrary <i>PASSIONS</i>: viz. <i>Horror</i>, <i>Sadness</i>, <i>Fear</i>,
and <i>Sorrow</i> at another’s <i>Good</i>, without its own <i>Hurt</i>;
which is call’d <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Envy</span></em>, being a <i>Sadness</i> at another’s
<i>Prosperity</i>, as <i>Pity</i> is a certain kind of <i>Sadness</i> at another’s
<i>Misery</i> or <i>Adversity</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> not to insist on these <i>Topicks</i>, I shall only
add a few Words upon the <i>PASSIONS of the Mind</i>;
which are nothing else than certain <i>Motions</i> or <i>Inclinations</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>proceeding from the <i>Apprehension</i> of any Thing, as
of <i>Good</i> or <i>Evil</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <span class='sc'>Apprehensions</span> are of three different Sorts,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Sensual</i>, <i>Rational</i>, and <i>Intellectual</i>. And according to
<i>them</i>, there are <i>three</i> Sorts of <span class='sc'>Passions</span> in the <i>Soul</i>; the
<i>first</i>, following the <i>sensual</i> <span class='sc'>Apprehension</span>, respects a
temporal <i>Good</i> or <i>Evil</i>, under the Notion of <i>Profit</i> or <i>Loss</i>,
<i>Defence</i> or <i>Offence</i>, &amp;c: and they are called <i>Natural</i> or
<i>Animal Passions</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>second</i> following the <i>Rational</i> <span class='sc'>Apprehension</span>,
respects <i>Good</i> or <i>Bad</i>, under the Notion of <i>Virtue</i> or <i>Vice</i>,
<i>Praise</i> or <i>Disgrace</i>, &amp;c: and they are called <i>Rational</i> or
<i>Voluntary Passions</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>third</i>, following the <i>Intellectual</i> <span class='sc'>Apprehension</span>,
respects <i>Good</i> or <i>Evil</i>, under the Notion of <i>Truth</i> or
<i>Falsehood</i>, <i>Justice</i> or <i>Injustice</i>, &amp;c: and this Sort is call’d
<i>Intellectual Passions</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> these <i>three</i> different Sorts proceed all from the
<i>Energy</i> of the <span class='sc'>Soul</span>; which is divided into <i>Concupiscible</i>
and <i>Irascible</i>, both respecting <i>Good</i> and <i>Evil</i>, tho’
under different Notions: which Division affords us
<i>eleven</i> <span class='sc'>Passions</span> of the Mind, <i>viz.</i> <i>Love</i>, <i>Hatred</i>, <i>Desire</i>,
<i>Horror</i>, <i>Joy</i>, <i>Grief</i>, <i>Hope</i>, <i>Despair</i>, <i>Boldness</i>, <i>Fear</i>, and
<i>Anger</i>; all which might be particularly defin’d: But as
<i>that</i> is more the <i>Philosopher</i>’s than the <i>Physician</i>’s Business,
I shall proceed to that which is more strictly my
<i>Province</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VI.</span><br /> <i>Of the</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Humane Body</span></em>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>BESIDES</em> what has been said in the preceding
<i>Chapters</i>, touching the <em class='gesperrt'><i>SOUL</i></em>, its <i>Powers</i> and
<i>Faculties</i>; when we duly consider the beautiful <i>Form</i>
and amiable <i>Figure</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Body</span></em>, so nicely adapted
to the sublime <i>Qualities</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Soul</span></em>, with its curious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span><i>Structure</i>, and majestick <i>Stature</i>, erected to <i>Heaven</i>, whither
its natural Tendency leads; besides the proportionable
<i>Symmetry</i> and exact <i>Commensuration</i> of all its <i>Parts</i>:
Surely we cannot, I hope, without the greatest Amazement,
contemplate and admire the incomparable <i>Art</i>,
and incomprehensible <i>Skill</i>, of the great <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Artificer</em></span>:
And with magnificent <i>David</i><a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a>, break out in <i>Eulogies</i> of
Praise, and ardent <i>Exclamations</i> of Love and Admiration.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> more especially: <i>first</i>, when we distinctly view
the slender <i>Filaments</i>, the minute <i>Vessels</i>, the elaborate
<i>Contextures</i>, and various <i>Configurations</i> of the different
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Organs</em></span> of this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Body</em></span>. <i>Secondly</i>, When we duly consider
the Power of its natural <i>Faculties</i>, the Situation of
the <i>Entrails</i>, the Rise of the <i>Nerves</i> from the <i>Brain</i>, the
Ducts or Conduits of the <i>Arteries</i> from the <i>Heart</i>, and the
Original of the <i>Veins</i> from the <i>Liver</i>. <i>Thirdly</i>, When we
call to remembrance, and ponder what I have been hinting
upon, to wit, the <i>Power</i> of the natural <i>Faculties</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Soul</span>, by which they execute their relative <i>Functions</i>;
besides, the <i>Ætherial Spirit</i> (the Seat and Vehicle of our
<i>natural Heat</i>) dividing it self into a <i>three-fold Diversity</i>,
and appropriating to itself as many <i>Residences</i>, viz. the
<i>Animal</i> in the <i>Brain</i>, the <i>Vital</i> in the <i>Heart</i>, and the
<i>Natural</i> Spirit in the <i>Liver</i>: And then again, how these
<i>three</i>, by a Fomentation of <i>native Heat</i>, and <i>nutritious
Humours</i>, cherish and refresh the whole <span class='sc'>Body</span> supplying
every <i>Part</i> with requisite Strength and Vigour. <i>Fourthly</i>,
When at last we contemplate that Piece of incomprehensible
<i>Artifice</i>, which gives a respective <i>Species</i> and <i>Form</i> to
every particular <i>Part</i>, and implants a peculiar <i>Faculty</i>
in every distinct <i>Member</i>, inducing such an Excellency
into the whole <span class='sc'>Body</span>; that is, the <i>Formation</i> and <i>Delineation</i>
of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Foetus</em></span> in the <i>Womb</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> is such a great and curious <i>Master-piece</i>, that
all <i>Others</i>, as well as the <i>Physician</i>, will find it not only
their <i>Duty</i>, but also their great Satisfaction and Pleasure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>to know and examine into this inimitable <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Machine</em></span> of
the divine <i>Architect</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> great <i>Galen</i> was converted at a <i>Dissection</i>, and
durst not but acknowledge a <i>Supreme Being</i>, upon that
Survey of his admirable <i>Handy-work</i>; saying,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a> “<i>How
much is it our special Duty therefore to admire the Wisdom
and Providence of the Workman? Since, tho’ it is far
more easy to set forth in Words the Beginning of Things,
than to form the Work; yet our Expressions and Words
fall so much short of the Wisdom of him that made us,
that we are not able to explain, what gave him so little
trouble to make.</i>”</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> as <i>this</i> was a Man who had not been too <i>devout</i>,
so if the most <i>Profligate</i> would seriously weigh and
consider the elegant <i>Constitution</i> of such a vast Variety
of different <i>Textures</i>, the Nicety of these <i>Organical Works</i>,
the Curiosity of these <i>Embroideries</i>, and the Exactitude
of these <i>Figures</i>, which appear and seem rather to be
fitted for Admiration than Use; they would readily
conclude with that great <i>Naturalist</i>, that these Things
are the evident <i>Characteristicks</i> of some divine and omnipotent
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Power</em></span>, in that they are no ways to be accounted
for by such <i>natural Causes</i>, as may be thought
sufficient to explain the <i>Phænomena</i> of ignobler Beings.</p>

<p class='c005'>THIS <span class='sc'>Body</span>, therefore, being the Vessel and Receptacle
of the <span class='sc'>Soul</span>, the Engine and Instrument, in and
through which it operates; I judge it to be our incumbent
<i>Duty</i>, to take special Care, and nice Observation
of both <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Soul</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Body</em></span>: Since (in this Life) the <i>one</i>
cannot consist without the <i>other</i>, or discharge its respective
<i>Offices</i>; the <i>one</i> always requiring the <i>Ministry</i>
and <i>Assistance</i> of the <i>other</i>, which the <i>omniscient</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Artificer</em></span>
has so wisely ordered and ordained from all
Eternity.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet, I cannot agree with St. <i>Cyprian</i>,
that the animated and sensible Body is only used by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><span class='sc'>Soul</span>, as mechanical <i>Instruments</i> are by the <i>Workman</i>;
since I think a more proper <i>Simile</i> may be drawn from
the <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>: For tho’ the <i>Moon</i> borrows <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Light</span></em>
of the <i>Sun</i>, she is not altogether devoid of such a
<i>Power</i> or <i>Influence</i> as is proper to herself, being guided
and sustained by a <i>peculiar Motion</i>, whilst she absolves
her <i>own Circle</i>; taking <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Light</span></em> from the <i>Sun</i>, no otherways
than as a <i>Looking-Glass</i>, polish’d <i>Brass</i>, or <i>Copper</i>,
takes Splendor or <i>Refulgency</i> from an opposite <i>Fire</i> or
<i>Light</i>: For notwithstanding she exhibits no <i>Light</i>, unless
illuminated by the <i>Sun</i>; however yet, she is not idle or
desidious in accomplishing her <i>monthly Course</i>, and measuring
her own <i>Space</i> of the Heavens, and that without
any Assistance of the <i>Sun</i>. So the <span class='sc'>Soul</span> invigorates and
affords Strength to the <span class='sc'>Body</span>, which however is not
altogether without its own implanted <i>Faculties</i> and natural
<i>Powers</i>; the <i>four Qualities</i> of <i>Humours</i>, with which
ev’ry <span class='sc'>Body</span> abounds, capacitating and adapting it to all
Things within its own <i>Sphere</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FARTHER</em>, as the <i>Sun</i> suffers <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Eclipses</span></em>, and is
obscured by the Intervention of the <i>Moon</i>; and the <i>Moon</i>
again (in like manner) is eclipsed and obscured by the
Objection or Interposition of the <i>Earth</i>, the <i>Sun</i> always
running thro’ the <i>Ecliptick Line</i> in the same Degree, and
the Moon in <i>opposite Degrees</i>: So <span class='sc'>Body</span> and <span class='sc'>Soul</span> are subject
to their own Impediments and <i>Eclipses</i>; sometimes
<i>defending</i>, and sometimes <i>offending</i> one another; both
<i>sympathizing</i> mutually, and <i>participating</i> equally of one
another’s <i>Portion</i>. As it is evident from the very Words
of our <i>dying</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Saviour</span></em>, who, by reason of his Human
Weakness, broke out into these<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a>Words, <i>My Soul is exceeding
sorrowful, even unto Death</i>: Which <i>Death</i>, in the
next <i>Verse</i>, he, in a manner, deprecates of the <span class='sc'>Father</span>.
For though he was not yet insulted, or laid hands upon,
yet his whole <i>Mind</i> and <i>Thoughts</i> running upon his approaching
<i>Danger</i>, he was seiz’d with such Horror and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Trepidity, as express’d a <i>bloody Sweat</i>, which streamed
from his <i>whole Body</i>: so that the Acerbity of his <i>Grief</i>
must (of consequence) have been communicated to <i>both
Parts</i>; and beginning in the <span class='sc'>Soul</span>, did thence redound
into the <span class='sc'>Body</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> arises a rational and natural <i>Argument</i>,
that as <span class='sc'>Soul</span> and <span class='sc'>Body</span> do not only <i>act</i> in and thro’ one
another, but also <i>suffer</i> mutually, always <i>sympathizing</i>
with each other, and bearing equal <i>Share</i> in the <i>Troubles</i>,
<i>Misfortunes</i>, and <i>Inquietudes</i> of this Life; and that
as they <i>both</i> inseparably constitute the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Man</span></em>: So, by
reason of that natural <i>Sympathy</i>, and proximous <i>Affinity</i>,
as the <span class='sc'>Soul</span> enjoys <i>Immortality</i>, the renew’d <span class='sc'>Body</span> (by
the Mystery of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Resurrection</span></em>) will be a future
<i>Partaker</i> of the <i>same Reward</i>; and consequently the
<i>whole Man</i> must enjoy <i>one</i> and the <i>same State</i> of <i>Beatitude</i>;
or <i>otherways</i>, as he shall have promerited. Whence
I proceed to</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>spirituous Substance</i> of both <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Seeds</span></em>, by its
own generative and active <i>Qualities</i>, in a well disposed
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>, produceth a small <i>Consistence</i> within the
Space of <i>Seven Days</i>, call’d the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Genitura</span></em>; which
contains three<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c017'><sup>[13]</sup></a> <i>Bullæ</i> (so term’d by <i>Physicians</i>) superlatively
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Minute</span></em>, design’d for the <i>three Spermatick
Members</i>: The <i>one</i> containing the purer Part of the <i>Seed</i>,
full of <i>Vital Spirit</i>, for the <i>Heart</i>; the <i>other</i>, the more
thick and pinguid Part, full of <i>Natural Spirit</i>, for the
<i>Liver</i>; and the <i>third</i>, the more cold and crude Part,
full of <i>Animal Spirit</i>, for the <i>Brain</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><em class='gesperrt'>ACCORDING</em> to<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a> <i>Hippocrates</i>’s Definition of
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Genitura</span></em>, it appears the <i>likest</i> of any Thing to
a raw immature <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Egg</span></em>, inclosing a certain red <i>Liquor</i>,
with some pale-colour’d <i>Fibres</i>, of the finest <i>Contexture</i>,
not unlike the <i>Filaments</i> of a small <i>Spider’s Web</i>, wrap’d
up with the said red thick <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Blood</span></em> in the <i>Pellicule</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in this place I must farther observe, that the
abovesaid <i>spirituous Substance</i>, in which the effective Virtue
of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Conception</span></em> resides, is endued with <i>four</i>
distinct <i>Faculties</i>, which perfect as <i>many</i> different <i>Operations</i>,
all subordinately effected in the <i>Constitution</i> of the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Conception</span></em>, <i>viz</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>animatïve</i> or <i>vivificating</i> Faculty of the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Menstruum</span></em>, called by some the first <i>Constitutive Faculty</i>
of <i>Conception</i>, operating, as above, in <i>Seven Days</i>;
which is otherwise term’d the Time of <i>Spumification</i>,
<i>Lactation</i>, or <i>Coagulation</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>separative</i> or <i>severing Faculty</i> of the Parts
of the grosser <i>Materials</i> of the <i>Conception</i>, destinated for
the respective <i>Constitution</i> of the different <i>Organical Members</i>;
which, being the Work of the next <i>Eight</i> or <i>Ten
Days</i>, is perfected about the 15th or 17th <i>Day</i> from
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Conception</span></em>; and this is called the Time of <i>Lineation</i>
or <i>Ramification</i>, when the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Genitura</span></em> receives
the Name of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Embryo</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>collocative</i> or <i>ordinating Faculty</i> of all the severed
material Parts of the different <i>Members</i>, disposing and
placing them according to the <i>Law of Nature</i>, in due
Order, Figure, and Situation; which, happening the
following<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a> <i>Twelve</i> or <i>Fifteen Days</i>, about the 27th or
32d Day from <i>Conception</i>, is called the Time of <i>Carnification</i>;
when the Embryo receives the Name of
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Foetus</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> according to the Maxims of <i>Astrology</i>, as
all <i>inferiour Bodies</i> are govern’d and influenced by <i>Superiours</i>,
so the <i>Seven Planets</i> have Dominion over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span><i>Man</i>, not only from the Day of <i>Birth</i>, but also from
the Moment of <i>Conception</i>; yet not <i>All</i> at one and the
same Time, but every <i>one</i> in their <i>Order</i>, reigning each
its <i>peculiar Month</i>. According to which Principles,
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Saturn</span></em> reigns the <i>first</i> Month, suppeditating the
humid and liquid <i>Substance</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Genitura</span></em> and
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Embryo</span></em>, through his frigid and siccid <i>Quality’s</i> due
<i>Coagulation</i> for generating the <i>Man</i>;  by virtue of whose
<i>Siccity</i> the <i>uterine Retentions</i> also happen.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>formative</i> and <i>figurating Faculty</i> of all the
<i>Members</i> of the Body, imparting their respective <i>Shape</i>,
<i>Figure</i>, and natural <i>Form</i>, to every particular <i>one</i>;
which being the Work of the next <i>Eight</i> to <i>Eighteen
Days</i>, is perfected about the 35th, to the 50th Day
from <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Conception</span></em>, and is called the Time of <i>coarticulate
Formation</i>, when the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Foetus</span></em>, or <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Cyema</span></em>, is stil’d
<i>Infant</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> in this, the <i>second Month</i>, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Jupiter</span></em> is
supposed to exert his Power in the <i>Seed</i>, by his calid
and humid <i>Qualities</i>; and thereby to vivify the <i>Spirits</i>,
strengthen the <i>Members</i>, and give Augmentation and
Growth to the whole <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Foetus</span></em>: So that the <i>interior
Members</i> are not<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a> only conspicuous, but also <i>Legs</i> and
<i>Arms</i> appear perfectly delineated, and are (at this time)
distinctly <i>visible</i>; when also the <i>Head</i> takes its Distance
from the <i>Shoulders</i>, the <i>Arms</i> from the <i>Sides</i>, and the
<i>Legs</i> are plainly parted.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em>, however, the above-mention’d <i>Four remarkable
Times</i> may be also thus distinguished; <i>viz.</i> The <i>first</i>
perfects the Work of <i>Spumification</i> and <i>Coagulation</i>; the
<i>second</i> the <i>Vegetative</i>; the <i>third</i> the <i>Sensitive</i>; and the
<i>fourth</i> begins the <i>Rational Operation</i>:  Altho’ <i>this</i> cannot
yet be discern’d, because of the <i>Redundancy</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Humours</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> the beginning of this <i>Chapter</i>, ’tis evident
that the more <i>noble</i>, or <i>three chief Parts</i> take the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span><i>first beginning</i> to <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Formation</span></em>, tho’ perhaps last <i>perfected</i>,
which forthwith distribute their respective <i>Branches</i>
to the whole <i>Body</i>; as the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Heart</span></em> sends forth the
<i>Arteries</i>, the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Liver</span></em> the <i>Veins</i>, and the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Brain</span></em> the
<i>Spinal Marrow</i>, with all their other <i>Dependencies</i>: And
according to <i>Aristotle</i>, (who says, <i>there must be a different</i>
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Matter</span></em> <i>to every different</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Form</span></em>); So indeed every
distinct <i>Part</i> of the Body is <i>form’d</i> of a different Substance,
according to the different <i>Nature</i> and singular
<i>Disposition</i> of every particular <i>Part</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, I shall not here pretend to go
much farther in describing the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Formation</span></em>, it being
more the <i>Philosopher’s</i> than the <i>Physician’s</i> Business:
But whatever farther Progress <i>others</i> may attempt, I
judge it a most difficult and ambiguous Matter; for
who can be so well vers’d in those <i>Indiscoverables</i>? Or,
who can pretend to know sufficiently what is done in
those <i>Obscurities</i>? The <i>Series of Nature</i> being profounder
than our <i>Understandings</i>, is consequently above our nicest
and exactest <i>Scrutinies</i>: Which Consideration makes me
astonished at the <i>Logical Dissertations</i> that some Men
offer on these <i>Principles</i>, even on the most minute <i>Particles</i>,
and smallest <i>Proportions</i>, rashly and inconsiderately
assigning every respective <i>one</i> of these, a <i>precise definite
Time</i> for their <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Formation</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I <em class='gesperrt'>HAVE</em> often been inclin’d to think, that such
<span class='sc'>Sciolists</span> have not read, or at least not consider’d the
Words of the<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a> <i>Preacher</i>; <i>As thou knowest not what is the
Way of the</i> SPIRIT, <i>nor how the Bones do grow in the
Womb of her that is with Child; even so thou knowest not
the Works of</i> <em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> <i>that maketh all</i>. Neither do I find
that the wise<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c017'><sup>[18]</sup></a> <i>Hebrean</i> ever enter’d upon such <i>Syllogisms</i>,
who (to the contrary) testifies that <i>the Counsel of</i>
<em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em> <i>is not to be known</i>; <i>that our Thoughts are miserable,
and our Devices uncertain</i>. Upon which Authority, I
say, in this Case, as <i>that Labour</i> is commendable which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>can be compar’d to <i>Possibilities</i>, so to dive into those
<i>Things</i>, which exceed our <i>Judgments</i>, and admit of no
possible <i>Comparison</i>, is nothing better than <i>Folly</i>. Wherefore
All that is further requisite, or possible for us, is to
contemplate and admire the <i>Greatness</i> and <i>Elegancy</i>, the
<i>Sublimity</i> and <i>Profundity</i> of this wonderful and amazing
Work of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Formation</span></em>; which <i>Subject</i> (we find) hath
been the frequent Contemplation of <i>the Royal Prophet</i><a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a>,
particularly expressing himself, in the most eloquent
and sublime Terms, according to the <i>divine Light</i> of
his illuminated Understanding: Saying, <i>Thou hast possessed
my Reins: Thou hast ordered me in my Mother’s
Womb. I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully
made, marvellous are thy Works, and that my Soul
knoweth right well. My Substance was not hid from thee,
tho’ I was made in secret, and curiously fashioned in the
lowest Parts of the Earth. Thine Eyes did see my Bones,
yet being imperfect; and in thy Book were all my Members
written; which Day by Day were formed, when as yet there
was none of them.</i> Whence I proceed in order, to</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VIII.</span><br /> <i>Of the Animation of the <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em>.</i></h3>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>human Fœtus</i> being duly form’d and organiz’d
about the 50th Day at the latest, as we observed
in the preceeding <i>Chapter</i>, it remains to be <i>animated</i>,
and that with a three-fold <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Soul</span></em>, <i>viz.</i> a <i>vegetative</i>, a
<i>sensitive</i>, and a <i>rational Soul</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>First</i> of which, according to the most learned
<i>Fortunius<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c017'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Licetus</i>, &amp;c. may be ascribed to the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Mother</span></em>,
as chiefly proceeding from the Power of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><i>Menstruum</i>. The <i>Second</i> may (by the same Authority)
be ascribed to the <i>Power</i> and <i>Spirit</i> of the <i>Paternal Seed</i>;
but it is the more generally received Opinion, that
the <i>vegetative Soul</i> is generated from the <i>Commixture</i> of
both Seeds with the <i>Menstruum</i>, and therefore as much
to be ascribed to the <i>one</i>, as to the <i>other</i>, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Parent</span></em>:
And that also the <i>sensitive SOUL</i> proceeds from the proper
<i>natural Faculty</i> of the organiz’d <i>Fœtus</i>, as the <i>rational
<em class='gesperrt'>SOUL</em></i> doth from the immediate <i>Infusion</i> of the great
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Creator</span></em>. Touching which <i>Infusion</i>, I desire not to
meddle with the <i>Controversy</i> that has so long subsisted
betwixt <i>Philosophers</i> and <i>Divines</i>: Only as I have noted
in <i>Chap.</i> iv. the Opinion of the greatest <i>Masters of Nature</i>;
so if, in <i>this</i>, we could, from the Dictates of
<i>Faith</i> and <i>Religion</i>, as well as from the Maxims of <i>natural
Philosophy</i>, set the Matter in a clearer <i>Light</i>, I
humbly presume it would not be <i>disagreeable</i>: Since the
<i>Principles</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Either</span></em>, taken separately, are in themselves
<i>mysterious</i>, and can never be fully comprehended by
<i>some</i>; whereas, <i>both</i> taken jointly, I mean, the Arguments
of the <i>one</i>, to reinforce the Positions of the <i>other</i>,
may be satisfactory to <i>all</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> order to which, I <i>first</i> observe; That the <i>Influx</i>
of celestial Bodies exerts its Power very efficaciously
in all <i>Sublunaries</i> and <i>Inferiours</i>. Hence, touching the
<i>four Humours</i> of our Bodies, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Mars</span></em> is thought to excite
the <i>yellow Bile</i>, as <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Saturn</span></em> exasperates <i>Melancholy</i>; and
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Luna</span></em> to encrease <i>Phlegm</i>, as <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Sol</span></em> and <span class='sc'>Jupiter</span> govern
the <i>Blood</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, I observe, That the Power and
<i>Influence</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Planets</span></em> lies effectually in <i>Metals</i>,
<i>Stones</i>, <i>Gems</i>, <i>Herbs</i>, <i>Roots</i>, and all <i>Subterranean Bodies</i>;
as <i>Gold</i>, <i>Silver</i>, <i>Copper</i>, <i>Iron</i>, <i>Tin</i>, <i>Lead</i>, and whatever is
contained in the <i>Bowels of the Earth</i>, whether it tend to
<i>Use</i> or <i>Necessity, Profit</i> or <i>Pleasure</i>; the <i>Virtues</i> and <i>Increase</i>
of them all proceeding from their <i>peculiar</i> <span class='sc'>Stars</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> we may easily conceive, by considering that
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, who made all things for his singular, great, and
good Ends, would never have exhibited to us such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>fair and spacious <i>Heaven</i>, such a <i>Course</i>, <i>Order</i>, <i>Continuation</i>,
and <i>Series</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Stars</span></em> to delight and feed our
<i>Eyes</i>, like an empty <i>Shadow</i>, or an idle <i>Picture</i>: But,
to the contrary, the <i>Trees</i>, the <i>Roots</i>, the <i>Branches</i>, the
<i>Seas</i>, the <i>Rivers</i>, the <i>Streams</i>, and whatever runs thro’
the Veins of the <i>Earth</i>, or graces the Surface of <i>Sea</i> or
<i>Land</i>; yea, whatever is, or may be distinguished by
the Variety of <i>Things</i> or <i>Names</i>, together with our
<i>Bodies</i>, and their implanted <i>Humours</i>, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>He</span></em> subjected to
the <i>Heavens</i>, that they might perceive some superiour
<i>Impulse</i>, <i>Motion</i>, and <i>Agitation</i> from the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Stars</span></em>, and experience
the Utility of their <i>Effects</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> the learned <i>Arabians</i> ascribed the <i>Bodies</i>,
<i>Actions</i>, and <i>Dispositions</i> of Men to <span class='sc'>Stars</span> and <span class='sc'>Signs</span>:
As <i>Proclus</i> teacheth, that <i>Superiours</i> and <i>Inferiours</i> are
manifestly <i>one</i> in the <i>other</i>. But these <i>Inferiours</i> are defin’d,
some to be <span class='sc'>Solar</span>, others <span class='sc'>Lunar</span>; on which the
<span class='sc'>Sun</span> and <span class='sc'>Moon</span> make strong <i>Impressions</i>, like those of the
<span class='sc'>Stars</span> and <span class='sc'>Signs</span> they are under. In reference to which,
they distribute the <i>human Body</i> among the <i>Planets</i> and
<i>Signs</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Zodiack</span></em>; and most ingeniously demonstrate,
that as the <i>Triplicities</i> of those <i>Signs</i> answer one
another, and agree in <i>Celestials</i>, so they also concur in
the <i>Members of the</i> <span class='sc'>Body</span>; which Observation, daily <i>Experience</i>
also confirms. As for example: By a <i>Coldness</i> of
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Feet</span></em>, the <i>Belly</i> and <i>Breast</i> are affected; and these
<i>Members</i> answering to the same <i>Triplicity</i>, any proper
<i>Medicine</i> apply’d to the <i>one</i>, helps the <i>other</i>; as by warming
the <i>Feet</i>, the Pain of the <i>Belly</i> ceaseth.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em>, if we consider the many <i>occult
Qualities</i>, and <i>secret Influences</i> of celestial Bodies, besides
these <i>three</i> which are manifest to us, namely, <i>Heat</i>,
<i>Light</i>, and <i>Motion</i>, we shall readily and rationally agree
with <i>Astrologers</i>, as well as <i>Philosophers</i>, in this Point;
that the <i>celestial Bodies</i> concur with other <i>natural Causes</i>,
in the regular <i>Procession</i> of all the different Steps of the
<i>Conformation</i> and <i>Constitution</i> of human <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Conception</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, in the Work of <i>Animation</i>,
they concur not only <i>physically</i>, but <i>efficiently</i>; not as formal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>final, or material <i>Causes</i>, but meerly by <i>Action</i>;
upon which Great <i>Efficient</i>, all other <i>Causes</i> depend. And
yet they concur <i>efficiently</i> not as the only particular,
immediate, and proximous <i>Agents</i>, but as the common
remote, physical <i>Agents</i>, moving <i>physically</i>. Now this
<i>Aristotle</i> also plainly teacheth, saying; that, “As this
<i>inferiour World</i> hath Existence from <i>superiour Beings</i>,
so all worldly Existences must necessarily be ordered
and directed by <i>those</i>, as the common <i>efficient Cause</i> of
all <i>Sub-celestials</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> I would farther observe, that the only <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Action</span></em>
of <i>those Bodies</i> in this Work, is to dispose and
govern all proper, special, and singular <i>Causes</i> pertaining
to <i>Nature</i>, preserving them <i>physically</i>; that is, by
their <i>Motion</i>, <i>Light</i>, and <i>Heat</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> reason I call <i>those Bodies</i> the remote, not the
proximous <i>Agents</i> in the Work, is, because they do not
in <i>Substance</i>, <i>Motion</i>, or <i>Light</i>, immediately reach or
touch the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Foetus</span></em>; but only, by their secret <i>Qualities</i>
and <i>Influences</i>, extended to these inferiour <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Orbs</span></em>, penetrate
through, and affect the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>, tho’ never so
closely shut up: By which means, the <i>Spirit</i> and <i>Power</i>
of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Seeds</span></em>, the <i>Faculties</i> of the <i>Womb</i>, and all concurring
<i>Causes</i> are fomented, govern’d, promoted, preserv’d,
and determin’d.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, in this <i>Constitution</i>, (whatever <i>natural
Causes</i> may be advanc’d) the great <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> is indisputably
and undeniably the prime and principal
<i>Efficient</i>: for all other <i>Causes</i>, whether proximous or
remote, without his <i>Concurrence</i>, would be but vain and
insufficient, for the following Reasons.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> is the only primary <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Agent</span></em>, not <i>physical</i>,
because not acting <i>physically</i>; not operating by <i>Motion</i>,
because <i>immoveable</i>: but without <i>Motion</i>, and all other
<i>physical Helps</i>, he powerfully and clearly displays <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Himself</span></em>,
most eminently officiating by his own <i>All-sufficiency</i>,
and Appointment of <i>Nature</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>II. <em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> likewise, as the prime, common, remote,
and physical <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Cause</span></em>, governs and directs all <i>other secundary
Causes</i> supereminently, which are subjected to,
and dependent upon <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Himself</span></em>; in constituting, organizing,
and fomenting the <i>CONCEPTION</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> finally, as the proper, proximous, and immediate
<span class='sc'>Cause</span>, or <span class='sc'>Agent</span>, directing <i>none else</i>, nor using
any <i>other Assistance</i> in the Work, neither being <i>directed</i>
nor <i>assisted</i> by any <i>other</i>, gives to the organiz’d human
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Foetus</span></em> its greatest Completion; and the <i>ultimate finishing
Stroke</i> of consummate <i>Perfection</i>, by infusing and
communicating to it a <i>Mind</i> in a rational <i>SOUL</i>, by
which the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Foetus</span></em> becomes <i>MAN</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> this <i>Infusion</i> comes immediately from, and of
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Himself</span></em>, who is (in <i>Aristotle</i>’s Words): “The <i>Form</i>
and <i>Former</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Universe</span></em>, the ultimate <i>End</i>,
the final and efficient <i>Cause</i> of all <i>celestial Bodies</i>, and
<i>created Beings</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> now, as to the <i>Time</i> of this great Work of
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Animation</span></em>, <i>Naturalists</i> agree, that it requires
double the <i>Space</i> that <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Formation</span></em> had from <i>Conception</i>:
which seems so far probable, because at <i>that
time</i>, and no sooner, the <i>Infant</i> may be sensibly perceiv’d
to move; and <i>that</i> by the <i>Influence</i> of calid and
siccid <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Mars</span></em>, who (according to <i>Astrologers</i>) now
takes charge of it in the <i>third Month</i>. For by virtue
of his <i>hot Quality</i>, he perfecteth the <i>three</i> principal
Members, separating the <i>Legs</i>, <i>Arms</i>, and <i>Head</i> (in
due proportion) from the <i>rest</i>: Wherefore this <i>auspicious
Planet</i> is called the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Author</span></em> of the <i>Infant’s Motion</i>.
So that, in fine, conformable to what is laid down in
the preceeding <i>Chapter</i>, the Work of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Animation</span></em> is
perfected, at soonest, about the 70th, and at latest,
about the 100th Day from <i>CONCEPTION</i>. Which
being done, I proceed to the next <i>principal Work</i> in
constituting the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Man</span></em>.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>NATURALISTS</em> allow the <i>Infant</i>, for its ripening
in the <i>Womb</i>, and to the legitimate <i>Time
of Birth</i>, treble the <i>Space</i> that <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Animation</span></em> had; as
<i>Physicians</i> agree in allowing <i>this</i> treble the Time that
the <i>first Motion</i> had from <i>Conception</i>: and from hence the
4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, <i>&amp;c.</i> are called <i>ripening Months</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>fourth Month, Astrologers</i> will have the <i>Planet</i>
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Sol</span></em> to reign over the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Infant</span></em>; whose <i>calid Quality</i>
gives it entire <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Life</span></em>, fully perfecting the <i>Members</i>, excavating
the <i>Bones</i>, and amplifying the <i>Pores</i> and <i>Passages</i>
of the Body.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em>, in the <i>Fifth</i>, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Venus</span></em> presides over the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>;
who, by her <i>Frigidity</i> and <i>Humidity</i>, mitigates the <i>Heat</i>
and <i>Siccity</i> impressed on it by the <i>superiour Planets</i>, absolutely
perfecting the <i>Lineaments</i> of the <i>external Members</i>.
According to which Principles, she, in a word,
forms the <i>Privities</i> of both <i>Sexes</i>; and adds Beauty and
Ornament to the <i>Nose</i>, <i>Mouth</i>, <i>Hands</i>, <i>Fingers</i>, and all
the rest of the <i>visible Parts</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='fss'>AS</span> also, in the <i>sixth Month</i>, <span class='sc'>Mercury</span> takes his Turn
to assist the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Infant</span></em>, which puts the last finishing
Hand to the <i>Work</i>; perfecting the <i>Organs</i> of the <i>Voice</i>,
enlarging the <i>Eyes</i>, <i>Eye-lids</i>, <i>Brows</i>, and <i>Nails</i>; promoting
and confirming the <i>Instruments</i> of <i>Motion</i>; and
at last, absolving and compleating whatever the <i>others</i>
have commenced.</p>

<p class='c005'>I shall only farther <i>hypothetically</i> observe, that, if the
<span class='sc'>Infant</span> was perfectly <i>form’d</i> about the 35th <i>Day</i>, it was
<i>animated</i> about the 70th, and consequently will be <i>born</i>
about the 210th <i>Day</i>, the last of the 7th <i>Month</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> the <i>Formation</i> was perfected about the 40th <i>Day</i>,
the <i>Animation</i> happen’d about the 80th, and the <i>BIRTH</i>
will (unluckily) happen towards the close of the 8th
<i>Month</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> <i>Formation</i> happen’d the 45th, <i>Animation</i> follow’d
the 90th <i>Day</i>, and the <em class='gesperrt'><i>BIRTH</i></em> will succeed about
the close of 9 <i>Months</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> <i>Formation</i> was compleated the 50th, <i>Animation</i>
follow’d the 100th Day, and consequently the <i>BIRTH</i><a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c017'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
will appear about the last of 10 <i>Months</i>; and so of any
other certain <i>Time</i>, definite <i>Day</i>, or stated <i>Hour</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is, in all the above-mentioned <i>Cases</i>, to be farther
animadverted, that the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Male</span></em>, as he proceeds
from the more <i>calid</i>, <i>siccid</i>, and <i>spirituous Seed</i>, arrives
sooner to Perfection in <i>Formation</i> and <i>Animation</i>; and is
consequently <i>sooner born</i> than the <span class='sc'>Female</span>, whose <i>Nature</i>
is more <i>cold</i>, <i>flaccid</i>, and <i>weak</i>, even in the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>:
Hence an Allowance of a few Days more or less<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c017'><sup>[22]</sup></a>, may

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> is manifest, that the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Foetus</span></em> is nourished
in the <i>first Months</i>, by the <i>Umbilical Vessels</i> only:
But the several following <i>Reasons</i> engage me to think;
that, in the <i>latter Months</i>, it is alimented by the <i>Mouth</i>
also, and <i>That</i> by a glutinous <i>limpid Liquor</i>: Which,
being (probably) secreted from the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Amnion</span></em> for that
Purpose, is found to surround it.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>BECAUSE</em> this <i>Liquor</i>, which seems very
proper for that <i>Use</i>, is found not only in the <i>Mouth</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>but also in the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>OEsophagus</span></em> and <i>Stomach</i> of the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is found <i>changed</i> in the smaller <i>Intestines</i><a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c017'><sup>[23]</sup></a>;
and being <i>chylify’d</i> in the <i>Ventricle</i>, it turns to <i>Excrements</i>,
call’d <span class='sc'>Meconium</span>, in the <span class='sc'>Rectum</span>, or <i>strait
Gut</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>WE</em> find a <i>large</i> Quantity of this <i>Liquor</i>, surrounding
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Fœtus</span></em> in the <i>first Months</i>, and but
<i>little</i> in the <i>last</i>; which cannot probably be consum’d
any <i>other</i> way, than by the <i><em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>BECAUSE</em><a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c017'><sup>[24]</sup></a> that the <i>Oesophagus</i>, <i>Intestines</i>,
<i>lacteal Vessels</i>, and <i>thoracick Duct</i>, may continue open,
and be gradually accustomed to their respective <i>Functions</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> Infant’s <i>Situation</i>, in the <i>first</i> and <i>middle
Months</i>, is various; but, in the <i>latter</i>, it is commonly
observ’d to be of an <i>oval Figure</i>: Sitting, with the
<i>Head</i> hanging down, and the <i>Chin</i> upon the <i>Breast</i>;
the <i>Neck</i> bending forwards, the <i>Back</i> is round; embracing
the <i>Knees</i>, which are drawn up towards the
<i>Cheeks</i> with its <i>Arms</i>; the <i>Hands</i> commonly hanging
down, seem to embrace the <i>Feet</i>; the <i>Heels</i> cling close
to the <i>Buttocks</i>; and while the <i>Head</i> is uppermost, the
<i>Face</i> is towards the <i>Mother’s Belly</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> about the Time of <i>Birth</i>; the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, which
was always before <i>Lighter</i>, becomes considerably <i>Heavier</i>
than any other Part. And its ponderous <i>Bulk</i> bearing
much smaller Proportion to its <i>Substance</i> than it did before,
must needs (consequently) tumble Heels over
Head, in the <i>Waters</i> of the <span class='sc'>Membranes</span>; and the <i>Head</i>
falling downwards, the <i>Feet</i> get uppermost, and the
<i>Face</i> is turn’d towards the <i>Mother’s Back</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> because this is a painful and irksome <i>Posture</i>,
however favourable for its <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Exit</span></em>; the <i>Motions</i> it makes
for its Relief, occasion frequent <i>Pains</i> to the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>which cause a Contraction of the <i>WOMB</i>, for the Expulsion
of the <i>Infant</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em>, in short, this being the <i>natural Posture</i> of
the <i>Infant</i> in the <i>WOMB</i>, its <i>preternatural Positions</i> may
from thence be easily conceived.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Chorion</i> is rough and unequal on the <i>Outside</i>,

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Waters</span></em> are of infinite Service to the

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XII.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>SECUNDINE</em>, or <em class='gesperrt'>AFTER-BIRTH</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>SECUNDINE</i> is a thick carnous <i>Mass</i>, of a
soft <i>vasculous Substance</i>, compos’d of the <i>maternal
Menstrua</i>; which <i>waxes</i> upon the outside of the <i>Chorion</i>
in proportion with the Growth of the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span>; encreasing
(as the <i>Waters</i> do) together with the <i>Infant</i>. It
is also called the <i>Womb-Cake</i>, or <i>Placenta Uterina</i>; but
most commonly the <i>Woman’s AFTER-BIRTH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is call’d <i>Placenta</i>, because of its flat circular
<i>Figure</i>, resembling a pretty thick round Cake; being
about eight Inches <i>Diameter</i>, and one <i>Thick</i>; a little
thicker in the <i>Middle</i>, where the <i>Umbilical Vessels</i> are
fixed, than at the <i>Edges</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ITS</em> <i>thickest spongious Part</i> (properly call’d the <i>Placenta</i>)
adheres to the Bottom of the <i>Womb</i> by innumerable
<i>Vessels</i>, and the Interposition of a very thin <i>Membrane</i>,
which is a Continuation of the <i>Chorion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ITS</em> <i>Concave Part</i> towards the <i>Infant</i>, is join’d to
the <i>Navel-String</i>, and encompass’d with a smooth <i>Membrane</i>,
which it derives from the <i>Chorion</i> and <i>Amnion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Vessels</i> terminating in the <i>Navel-String</i>, are
inserted at <i>one End</i>, almost in the Center of the <i>Placenta</i>;
as the <i>other End</i> adheres to the <i>Navel</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>SECUNDINE</i> is rough and unequal on the
<i>Outside</i>, and smooth and soft on the <i>Inside</i>; and cannot
be extracted, without breaking the mentioned <i>Vessels</i>:
From hence an Effusion of <i>Humours</i> and Fluxion of
<i>Blood</i> always follows it; which (according to the <i>Woman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>State of Health</i>) is of a <i>fairer</i>, or <i>darker</i>, red <i>Colour</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> Use of the <i>SECUNDINE</i>, is to receive and
absorb the <i>Nutritious Juice</i> from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; (as the
<i>Intestines</i> imbibe the <i>Chyle</i>) which it afterwards transmits
to the <i>Infant</i>, by the <i>Umbilical Vein</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> Case of <span class='sc'>Twins</span>, or more <i>Children</i>, if conceived
at <i>one Time</i>, they have but <i>one common SECUNDINE</i>,
(notwithstanding the contrary Opinion of <i>others</i>) which
adheres to the <i>Fund</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, by the <i>Placenta</i>, as
above: Wherefore I must needs reject the <i>Testimony</i> of
such <span class='sc'>Midwives</span>, who give out that they have found
the <i>SECUNDINE</i>, <i>fix’d</i> to any <i>other Part</i> of the

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XIII.</span><br /> <i>Of the UMBILICAL VESSELS, or NAVEL-STRING.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> three <i>Umbilical Vessels</i> consist of <i>one Vein</i> and
<i>Two Arteries</i>; which compose the <i><em class='gesperrt'>NAVEL-STRING</em></i>,
and are wrap’d up in one strong <i>Membrane</i>,
proceeding from the <span class='sc'>Chorion</span> and <span class='sc'>Amnion</span>, between
the <i>Navel</i> and <i>Placenta</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Vein</i> arises in the <i>Placenta</i>, from innumerable
minute <i>Vessels</i>; proceeding thence with <i>Spiral Contortions</i>
between the <i>Arteries</i>, thro’ the <i><em class='gesperrt'>NAVEL-STRING</em></i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and <i>Navel</i>, to the <i>Liver</i> of the <i>Infant</i>; terminating in
the <i>Sinus</i> of the <i>Vena Porta</i>, into which it pours the
<i>Blood</i> and <i>nutritious Juice</i> received in the <i>Placenta</i>;
which immediately proceeds to the <i>Vena Cava</i>, and
<i>Heart</i>, thro’ a <i>Cylindrical Canal</i> (call’d <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Venosus</span></span>) opposite
to the <i>Umbilical Vein</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Arteries</i>, which are scarce half so large as the
<i>Vein</i>, arise from the <span class='sc'>Iliacs</span> of the <i>Infant</i>, or from the
<span class='sc'>Aorta</span>. They pass both Sides of the <i>Bladder</i> to the
<i>Navel</i>, and thence through the <em class='gesperrt'><i>NAVEL-STRING</i></em>,
by the like <i>Spiral Windings</i>, to the <i>Placenta</i>: where,
after distributing some <i>Branches</i> to the <span class='sc'>Amnion</span> and
<span class='sc'>Chorion</span>; they are divided into a very great Number
of <i>Sprigs</i>, transferring the <i>Blood</i> from the <i>Fœtus</i> to the
<em class='gesperrt'><i>SECUNDINE</i></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>Two Arteries</i>, with the above-mentioned
<i>one Vein</i>, make up a certain <i>Part</i>, twisted like a <i>Rope</i>,
about one Inch thick, and near a Yard long, call’d the
<em class='gesperrt'><i>NAVEL-STRING</i></em>; which is so ordained of this
<i>Length</i>, that the <i>Infant</i>, by its <i>Motion</i>, may not pull the
<i>Placenta</i> from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; and that, by its <i>Means</i>, the
<em class='gesperrt'><i>SECUNDINE</i></em> may be commodiously extracted
after the <i>Birth</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> Case of <span class='sc'>Twins</span>, or more <i>Children</i>, every one has
its proper <em class='gesperrt'><i>NAVEL-STRING</i></em>; the chief Use of
which is, to convey the <i>Maternal Blood</i> and <i>nutritious

The <i>Arteries</i> carrying back that which is unfit for this
<i>Use</i>, to the <i>Placenta</i>; whilst the <i>Fœtus</i> is still supply’d
with more by the <i>Vein</i>: So that there’s a <i>continual

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> II.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>VIRGINITY</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>VIRGINITY</em> is an entire <i>State of Nature</i> in
this Point; and nothing else, than the <i>Integrity</i> of
the <i>Muliebrian Parts</i> from the Violence of <i>Virile Congress</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>TOUCHING</em> the real <i>Signs</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><i>VIRGINITY</i></em>,
many learned <i>Controversies</i> have risen; particularly as
to the <i>Membrane</i>, call’d <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Hymen</span></em>: <i>Some</i> great <i>Anatomists</i>
and <i>Physicians</i><a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c017'><sup>[25]</sup></a> strenuously denying its <i>Existence</i>, and
representing it as some <i>preternatural Production</i>; and
<i>Others</i><a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c017'><sup>[26]</sup></a> as vigorously maintaining the contrary Opinion.
Upon which <i>Contention</i>, if I may humbly offer my <i>Sentiment</i>;
the <i>later Authorities</i> are so commonly receiv’d,
that (I think) this <i>Dispute</i> sufficiently decided.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WE</em> find the <i>Reality</i> of it has been abundantly
confirm’d by the <i>Greeks</i>, as it was discover’d by the
<i>Arabians</i> of old: And the <i>Gentiles</i>, for that very Reason,
call’d their <i>Nuptial God</i>, <span class='sc'>Hymeneus</span>. But, moreover,
being since so positively asserted, by so many
<i>famous</i> and <i>learned Men</i>, who openly vouch and aver
that they have found and seen it; I do not see why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>we should longer doubt of this <i>Membrane’s</i> being to be
found in <i>Most</i>, if not in <i>All</i>, <em class='gesperrt'><i>VIRGINS</i></em>, to distinguish
them from the rest of their <i>Sex</i>: Especially since
’tis certain, that something <i>extraordinary</i> happens in the
first <span class='sc'>Coition</span>, which made <i>Terentius</i> call it, <i>Coitio Acerrima</i>.
Upon which Notion, <i>Catullus’s</i> Verses are very

<p class='c018'>In short, many <i>Philosophers</i>, as well as <i>Poets</i>, hold
<i>This</i> for an infallible Symptom.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, tho’ I must confess <i>This</i> to be a
certain <i>Sign</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><i>VIRGINITY</i></em>, when it does appear;
yet, if it don’t, the <em class='gesperrt'><i>VIRGIN</i></em> is not therefore to be
<i>suspected</i>: especially if she be more <i>adult</i>, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Case the <i>Parts</i> grow both larger and firmer, by the
long <i>Flux</i> of the <i>Menstrua</i>; and consequently this <i>Effusion</i>
cannot well be expected; neither can it be supposed
in case of any violent <i>Procatarctick</i> or <i>Primary
Cause</i> (and from <i>That</i> she can be no more <i>secure</i>, than
another Person) which may break the <span class='sc'>Hymen</span>, and
dilate the <i>Parts</i> before <span class='sc'>Coition</span>. But besides,</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NEITHER</em> can the <i>Mosaical Law</i>, nor the <i>Customs</i>
of other Countries, imply any thing <i>farther</i>; than, that
<i>This</i> is the indubitable <i>Mark</i> of <i>VIRGINITY</i> when
it appears, without drawing any <i>suspicious Consequences</i>
from its accidental <i>Non-appearance</i>: especially considering,
that their <i>VIRGINS</i> married always very <i>young</i>,
and commonly about the 12th or 13th Year of their
<i>Age</i>; when they could scarce possibly be without some
evident <i>Effusion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>OTHERS</em> will have the <i>Astriction</i> of the <span class='sc'>Vagina</span>,
to be a certain <i>Sign</i> of <i>VIRGINITY</i>; which, (tho’ I
confess, is more astrict in <i>VIRGINS</i>, than in such as
have <i>copulated</i>) I deny, to be any <i>certain Sign</i>: Since all
know, That <i>Part</i> to differ (in this Point) according
to <i>Age</i>, <i>Habit</i>, and other <i>Circumstances</i> of Body and
Health: But besides, some <i>astringent Medicines</i> would
also easily answer this <i>End</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>OTHERS</em> again have disputed the <i>Possibility</i> of
a <em class='gesperrt'><i>VIRGIN</i></em>’s generating <i>Milk</i>; affirming <i>Milk</i> in the
<i>Breasts</i>, to be a certain <i>Sign</i> of lost <em class='gesperrt'><i>VIRGINITY</i></em>:
And (I think) there is some Reason for this Opinion;
for my part, I would inform myself better, before I
should credit <i>Her</i>, who would give herself out for a
<i>VIRGIN</i>, having this <i>Symptom</i>; notwithstanding the
contrary Opinion of <i>others</i>, founded upon the Authority
of <i>Hippocrates</i><a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c017'><sup>[27]</sup></a>: Since, according to the Judgment
of the most learned <i>Mauritius Cordæus</i><a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c017'><sup>[28]</sup></a>, it very seldom
happens. But if after All, a <i>VIRGIN</i> chances to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>have <i>Milk</i> in her <i>Breasts</i>, it differs in <i>Quantity</i> as well as
<i>Quality</i>, from <i>That</i> of a Woman who has conceiv’d:
For which Reason, he distinguishes and describes <i>Two
Sorts</i> of <span class='sc'>Milk</span>: <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>One</i>, which belongs to <i>this Case</i>, he says, is
generated of <i>Blood</i> flowing to the <i>Breasts</i>, when deny’d
an <i>Exit</i> by the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; and is nothing but the <i>superfluous
Aliment</i> of the <i>Breasts</i>, by their <i>peculiar Faculty</i>,
turn’d into <span class='sc'>Milk</span>: Which may happen to <em class='gesperrt'><i>VIRGINS</i></em>
irregular in their <i>Menstrua</i>; and according to this Interpretation,
<i>Hippocrates</i> is to be rightly understood.
The <i>other</i> <span class='sc'>Milk</span>, he calls <i>Puerperial</i>; which does not
generate without a <i>Big-Belly</i>, and <i>That</i> pretty far <i>Gone</i>:
Which <span class='sc'>Milk</span> is communicated from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> directly
to the <i>Breasts</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> teaches us also, that this <i>Difference</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Milk</em></span>,
proceeds from the Diversity of <i>Blood</i>, of which <i>both
Sorts</i> are generated; and likewise from the Variety of
the <i>Veins</i> and <i>Passages</i>, by which they are convey’d and
carry’d to the <i>Breasts</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> <i>Veins</i> are <i>Two-fold</i>; namely, <i>Common</i>
and <i>Proper</i>. The <i>Common</i> are called <i>External</i>, and these
are such as only carry the <i>Blood</i> from the <i>Vena Cava</i>,
for the Nutrition of the <span class='sc'>Breasts</span>; which, if <i>superfluous</i>,
or more than is <i>sufficient</i> for that <i>Use</i>, is converted (by
the <i>Glands</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Breasts</span></em>) into a kind of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Milk</span></em>:
Which, altho’ <i>white</i>, is of a <i>thinner Substance</i>, not so
<i>sweet</i>, nor so <i>plentiful</i>, as true <span class='sc'>Milk</span>. Whereas the proper
<i>Mammary Veins</i> carry that very <i>Blood</i>, of which
<span class='sc'>Milk</span> is generated for the Nourishment of the <i>Infant</i>,
from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> directly<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c017'><sup>[29]</sup></a>; which happens, by what
the <i>Greeks</i> call an <i>Anastomosis</i>, or Conjunction of the
<i>Mammary</i> and <i>Epigastrick Veins</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> hence we have the Difference of these
<i>two sorts</i> of <span class='sc'>Blood</span> and <span class='sc'>Milk</span>: Wherefore it is to be
concluded, that altho’ the <i>One</i> be found in the <i>Breasts</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of <i>VIRGINS</i>, they are not therefore to be rashly suspected
of <i>Pollution</i>; since, according to <i>Aristotle</i><a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c017'><sup>[30]</sup></a>, the
<i>same</i> may happen sometimes also to <span class='sc'>Men</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em>, besides what is mention’d, there are many
different external <i>Methods</i> propos’d by <i>Authors</i><a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c017'><sup>[31]</sup></a>, to distinguish
a <i>Real</i>, from a <i>Supposititious</i> <i>VIRGIN</i>: Which
however I shall not enter upon, lest what I have intended
for the <i>Benefit</i> of All in <i>general</i>, might tend to
the <i>Detriment</i> of some in <i>particular</i>. And thus having
briefly described the <i>MAIDEN</i> and <i>MAIDEN-HEAD</i>,
I come now to treat of such <i>Indispositions</i>, as are either
<i>Peculiar</i>, or more <i>Familiar</i> to her <i>STATE</i>. And, <i>First</i>,

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP</em>. III.</span><br /> <i>Of the Virgin-Disease, commonly called the <em class='gesperrt'>GREEN-SICKNESS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Malady</i> is an <i>Indisposition</i> visibly discolorating
the Complexion, and nothing else, but a
<i>Complication</i> of divers <i>Diseases</i> and <i>Symptoms</i>: Wherefore
it is variously represented and taken, sometimes for a
<i>Disease</i>, and sometimes for a <i>Symptom</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BE</em> that as it will; it is so Familiar, or rather Peculiar
to <i>Mature <em class='gesperrt'>VIRGINS</em></i>, that most <i>Physicians</i>
call it the <i>Virgin-Disease</i>, or <i>Virgin-Fever</i>; as <i>others</i>
call it <i>Febris Alba</i>, or pale Fever: Not that it is always
join’d with a <i>Fever</i>; but because the <i>affected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Party</i> represents (in most Respects) a <i>Feverish Person</i>, by
the Celerity and Frequency of Her <span class='sc'>Pulse</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is also call’d <i>Febris Amatoria</i>; I suppose, (partly)
because of the <i>Colour</i>, according to the <i>POET</i>; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Palleat
omnis Amans</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Color hic eft aptus Amanti</span></i>: And (partly)
because of the <i>Age</i>, which may be the fittest <i>Time</i> for
<span class='sc'>Love</span>; which made <i>Diogenes</i> say, at sight of a certain
<i>Patient</i>, That <i>she was dead in her <em class='gesperrt'>OWN</em></i>, <i>but alive in
ANOTHER Body</i>: As it is otherwise denominated
<i>Icterus Albus</i>; because, as in an <i>Icterus</i> or <i>JAUNDICE</i>,
the whole <i>Body</i> is tinctur’d <i>yellow</i>: So in this <i>Disorder</i>,
it is changed <i>Pale</i> and <i>Wan</i>; and from hence it is commonly
call’d the <i>GREEN-SICKNESS</i>, because of the
<i>Colour</i> and <i>Aspect</i> inclining a little that way. As it is
likewise also term’d, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fœdus seu pallidus Virginum Color</span></i>,
or the <i>ugly pale Colour of languishing VIRGINS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet I have known many <i>Women</i>, in
<i>France</i>, and <i>Germany</i>, who have been so far from thinking
it an ugly <i>Colour</i>, that they have esteem’d it most
<i>Beautiful</i>; and have used very <i>pernicious Things</i> to gain
and appropriate this <i>Colour</i> to Themselves: Esteeming
<i>Fresh-looking-Women</i>, of a fine sanguine <i>Complexion</i>, mere
<i><em class='gesperrt'>RUSTICKS</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> disagreeable <i>Affection</i> of the Body, however
it is <i>titled</i>, most certainly implies a <i>Complication of several
different Maladies</i>; annoying all the <i>Actions</i> of the
<i>Natural</i>, and <i>Motions</i> of the <i>Animal Faculty</i>: Or, in
short, perverting the whole <span class='sc'>Oeconomy</span> of the <i>Body</i>.
And because it is always join’d with <i>Most</i>, if not with
<i>All</i> the following <span class='sc'>Symptoms</span>, I think it may be regularly
thus defin’d.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>VIRGIN-DISEASE, is a Change of the natural
Colour of the Face into a pallid greenish Tincture; with a
Dejection of Strength, Gravity of all the Members and Parts
of the Body, Fastidy of Victuals, Malacia or Pica, Heaviness
and Palpitation of Heart, Difficulty of Breathing, a slow
Fever, Pains of the Head, Melancholy, Inflations, and Oedematous
Tumours of the Feet, Legs, Eye-lids, and the whole
Face; with a frigid Intemperature, and Cachexy of the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Body; proceeding from a deprav’d Nutrition, and the abundance
of crude Humours, ingender’d from a perverse Disposition
of the</i> <span class='sc'>Liver</span>, <span class='sc'>Spleen</span>, <i>or</i> <span class='sc'>Ventricle</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> proceed the <em class='gesperrt'><i>OBSTRUCTIONS</i></em> of the
<i>Uterine Vessels</i>, and neighbouring <i>Parts</i>, of the <i>Veins</i> of
the <i>LIVER</i>, and <i>SPLEEN</i>; but especially, of the <i>MESENTERY</i>:
So that the <i>natural Calidity</i> of the whole
<i>Body</i> being thus suffocated, and oppressed, by those
<i>crude Humours</i>, an Irregularity, or Suppression of the
<i>MENSTRUA</i>, must needs ensue.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BY</em> this <i>Definition</i>, the <em class='gesperrt'><i>DISEASE</i></em> may easily be
known; tho’ in some <i>Circumstances</i>, it may differ,
according to the different <i>Quality</i> of the predominant
<i>Humour</i>: Especially considering, that if all the foremention’d
<i>Signs</i>, or <i>Symptoms</i>, do not concur in all <i>PATIENTS</i>;
yet <i>Most</i> of them commonly do happen in
most <i>Persons</i>, and <span class='sc'>All</span> in <i>Some</i>. Whence I come <i>methodically</i>
to denote more particularly its <span class='sc'>Causes</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> order to which, I may justly premise, that the
<i>Proximous Cause</i> is a <i>Collection</i> of deprav’d <i>crude Humours</i>
in the Body: As the <i>Remote Cause</i>, is a <i>Suppression</i>, or
<i>Irregularity</i> in the Course of the <i>Menstruous Blood</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> this <i>Blood</i> flowing to the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, as soon as
the <i>VIRGIN</i> is <i>Mature</i>; if the <i>Passages</i> are not capacious
or patent enough, it <i>regorges</i> to the <i>Major Veins</i>, and
thence to the very <span class='sc'>Bowels</span>; extinguishing the <i>Heat</i>,
and obstructing the <i>Vessels</i> of the <i>LIVER</i>, <i>SPLEEN</i>,
and <i>MESENTERY</i>: From whence proceeds a vicious
<i>Concoction</i> and <i>Sanguification</i>; and consequently a <i>Collection
of crude Humours</i>, which excite various <i>Symptoms</i>
thro’ all Parts of the Body. And it commonly happens,
that an irregular or improper <i>Way of Living</i>,
especially about the Time of <i>Puberty</i>, or in the Time
of the <i>natural Course</i>, engenders a pituitous and viscid
<i>Blood</i>; which, together with the aforesaid <i>Humours</i>, totally
obstructs the <i>Uterine Vessels</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Distemper</i> is very dangerous, if not timely
<i>cur’d</i>; because if the <i>Heart</i> be very much affected, and
the <i>Vital Faculty</i> quite oppressed with it, the <i>Patient</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>often dies suddenly: Or, otherways, it commonly
turns to a <i>Dropsy</i>; and, when the <i>Humours</i> fly into
the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, it causes a <i>Frenzy</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> as I come gradually to set forth the <span class='sc'>Cure</span>
of this <i>Distemper</i>, I shall <i>First</i> observe; that, as various
<i>Diseases</i> and <i>Symptoms</i> do concur towards its <i>Complication</i>,
all <i>These</i> are to be discreetly remov’d by proper
<i>Means</i> and <i>Methods</i>. But that I may be better understood,
<i>SOME</i> are more prudently (perhaps) to be remov’d
<i>singly</i>; and <i>OTHERS</i>, <i>jointly</i>: As for Instance, if
any one <i>Symptom</i> be more troublesome and dangerous
than the <i>Rest</i>, it ought to be chiefly regarded above All
<i>others</i>; and, if not <i>remov’d</i>, at least <i>mitigated</i> in the First
Place.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, That a proper <i>Regulation</i> of <span class='sc'>Diet</span>
and <i>Regimen</i> of <span class='sc'>Body</span>, is to be judiciously directed, as
another initial necessary <i>Step</i> towards the <span class='sc'>Cure</span>; which
we have hereafter more fully treated of.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIRDLY</em>, That this <i>Distemper</i> is more easily
and sooner <i>cur’d</i>, in <i>Spring</i> or <i>Summer</i>-Time, than in
<i>Autumn</i> or <i>Winter</i>; because when the proper <i>Constitution</i>
of <i>WEATHER</i> and <i>AIR</i> concurs with the <i>medicinal
Means</i>, more may be done towards effecting its
<span class='sc'>Cure</span> in a <i>Week</i>, than otherways can be expected in a
<i>Month</i>. Wherefore <i>These</i> being premised, the <span class='sc'>Cure</span>
will most rationally depend upon the four following methodical
<i>STEPS</i>; <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> the vitious <i>Humours</i> lodged in the <i>Body</i>,
especially in the <i>Bowels</i>, be duly <i>prepar’d</i> for Expurgation,
and then effectually <i>evacuated</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> the <i>Intemperature</i> and <i>Obstructions</i> of the
<i>VENTRICLE</i>, <i>LIVER</i>, <i>SPLEEN</i>, and <i>WOMB</i>, be
All carefully and regularly removed.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> the <i>Menstrua</i> be duly rectify’d, and
physically reduc’d to a <i>Natural Course</i>, by the best <i>Conduct</i>
of Art and Judgment.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> the Rest of the morbifick <i>Humours</i>,
whether <i>Crude</i>, <i>Aqueous</i>, or <i>Serous</i>, lurking behind in the
<i>Body</i>, be in due manner discharg’d.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> more particularly; The <span class='sc'>Cure</span> may be begun
with a gentle <i>Evacuation of the Belly</i>, and, if Strength and
other Circumstances shall permit, with repeated <i>VENÆSECTIONS</i><a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c017'><sup>[32]</sup></a>,
or <i>Blood-letting</i> in the <i>Foot</i>, not only for
removing the <i>Plenitude</i>, but also for resolving the <i>Obstructions</i>
of the <em class='gesperrt'><i>MENSTRUA</i></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> because the <span class='sc'>Humours</span> are <i>Thick</i> and <i>Frigid</i>,
proper <i>warming</i> and <i>attenuating</i>, or preparing and purging
<i>Medicines</i> are to be used in their Turns; or <i>rarefying</i>
and <i>inciding Matters</i> may be mixed with the <i>Purgatives</i>.
As also in Case the <span class='sc'>Humours</span> lodge about the <i>Ventricle</i>
and <i>Mesentery</i>, a gentle <span class='sc'>Vomit</span> may be convenient.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> because divers <i>Parts</i> suffer <i>OBSTRUCTIONS</i>
in this sickly <i>Affection</i>, proper <i>Aperitives</i> are to be made
use of; and <i>Those</i> chiefly, which have a <i>natural Affinity</i>
with every respective <i>affected Part</i>: As for Example;
<i>Hepaticks</i>, for the <i>LIVER</i>; <i>Spleneticks</i>, for the <i>SPLEEN</i>;
<i>Uterines</i>, for the <i>WOMB</i>, &amp;c. Wherefore the <i>Physician</i>
ought to weigh and consider well, whether the <i>Veins</i>
about the <i>VENTRICLE</i> and <i>MESENTERY</i>, or <i>LIVER</i>
and <i>SPLEEN</i>, be most <i>obstructed</i>; since the most
special Regard must be had to the <i>Part most affected</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>Beginning</i>, such <i>Medicines</i> as serve best to
open the <i>Obstructions</i> of the <i>MESENTERY</i>, <i>SPLEEN</i>,
and <i>LIVER</i>, sparingly mix’d with such as provoke the
<i>MENSTRUA</i> or <i>MONTHS</i>, are to be discreetly used:
But afterwards, in <i>Progress</i> of the <span class='sc'>Cure</span>, the <i>Uterines</i> may
(by Degrees) be prudentially <i>augmented</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, at last it often happens, that tho’
the <i>grosser HUMOURS</i> are evacuated: yet some <i>watry,
serous Humours</i> remain in the Circuit of the Body, too
much refrigerating and infesting it still; which are most
conveniently remov’d by <i>Sudorificks</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> because the compleat <em class='gesperrt'><i>CURE</i></em> of this <i>Disease</i>
requires some Length of Time, I would advise proper
<i>Preparatives, Purgatives</i>, and <i>Corroboratives</i>, to be exhibited
by Turns; as also the very <i>Form</i> and <i>Composition</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of the <i>MEDICINES</i> to be varied in their Courses, for
the preventing of <i>Nauseousness</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Patient’s REGIMEN</i>, must likewise be well
prescrib’d, and curiously <i>regulated</i>; especially her <span class='sc'>Diet</span>.
She ought to live upon Victuals of the best <i>Nutrition</i>,
and easiest <i>Concoction</i>, carefully avoiding all <i>others</i> that
are not so agreeable: Especially such as are of a <i>frigid
or humid Quality</i>; such as <i>Pot-herbs</i>, <i>Garden-Fruits</i>, <i>Milk</i>
<i>Fish</i>, &amp;c. She may drink generous <i>Wine</i>, or good <i>Ale</i>
cautiously abstaining from all <i>small Drinks</i>, and other
such like noxious <i>Liquids</i>, as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, <i>Motion</i> and <i>Exercise</i> are very convenient,
not only in the <i>Beginning</i>, but also in the <i>Declension</i>
of this <i>DISEASE</i>; especially by strongly <i>Chafing</i>
and <i>Rubbing</i>, with warm <i>Flannels</i>, every Morning in
<i>Bed</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> <i>Sleep</i> is not to be too much indulged, especially
not in the <i>Mornings</i>; altho’ <i>she</i> be <i>Then</i> more propense
to it, by reason of the abundance of <i>VAPOURS</i>
ascending to the <i>Brain</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>LASTLY</em>, to perfect and confirm this <em class='gesperrt'><i>CURE</i></em>, I
would recommend<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c017'><sup>[33]</sup></a> <i>Hippocrates</i>’s sound Advice to the
<i>Patient</i>; which is to the following <i>Purpose</i>, of <i>marrying</i>
betimes for the sake of <i>Health</i>, and to prevent all the
future ill Consequences of this growing <i>Malady</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“<em class='gesperrt'>EGO</em>, <i>inquit, Autor sum, ut Virgines hoc malo

<p class='c006'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> which excellent <i>Sentence</i>, the two following

<p class='c006'>I have thought it proper to insist the <i>more</i> upon this

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SOME</em> however may think perhaps, that I had a
fair Opportunity in this <i>Place</i>, to introduce the various

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> <i>Objection</i> I humbly beg leave briefly to

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>BECAUSE</em> <i>They</i> are <i>common</i> to all <span class='sc'>Women</span> in

as to the <i>Virgin</i>; wherefore, I hope, another <i>Place</i> in
this <i>BOOK</i> may be assigned to <i>Them</i>, more proper and
convenient than <i>This</i>, without any <i>Digression</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>BY</em> reason the several <i>Branches</i> of these <span class='sc'>Heads</span>
are so very many and different, that to discuss ’em all
<i>Here</i>, as I ought to do, would too much swell the <i>Bulk</i>
of the <i>Volume</i>, and enhance the <i>Price</i> of this <i>BOOK</i>;
which I design for the Good of the <i>poorer</i> Sort of <i>Women</i>,
as well as the Benefit of the <i>Rich</i>. However,
what is most <i>Essential</i> and necessarily <i>Requisite</i>, shall not
be omitted (at least <i>coincidently</i>) in its <i>proper Place</i>.
Wherefore I shall leave the <span class='sc'>Virgin</span>, after a digressive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Hint in the following <i>Section</i>, upon her darling <i>Passion</i>,
[<em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVE</i></em>]: and supposing her to have <i>alter’d</i> her <i>Condition</i>,

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> IV.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>LOVE</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVE</i></em> is the <i>first Impression</i> that affects the <span class='sc'>Appetite</span>;
proceeding from the <i>Pleasure</i> conceiv’d in a <i>Real</i>
or <i>Imaginary GOOD</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is the <em class='gesperrt'><i>CEMENT</i></em> of <i>Affections</i>, and the <i>Effect</i>
of a certain <i>Congruity of Minds</i>; sympathetically arising
from the <i>DIASTOLE</i> and <i>SYSTOLE</i> of <i>affected Hearts</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is (as a certain <i>Author</i> defines it) a sacred <i>Frenzy</i>
of the <i>Soul</i>, and a <i>Divine Madness</i>, elevating <i>Men</i> to
the Pitch of <i>Saints</i>, and rendring them the Care of Benigner
<span class='sc'>Dæmons</span>: so far that they are every where <i>safe</i>,
being under the Protection of <em class='gesperrt'><i>GODS</i></em> and <i>Men</i>; as the
<i>Poet</i> familiarly expresses it, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quisquis Amore tenetur, eat
tutúsq; sacèrq</span></i>;——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is a kind of a wonderful satisfactory <i>Death</i>, and
a voluntary <i>Separation</i> of <span class='sc'>Soul</span> and <span class='sc'>Body</span>. The <span class='sc'>Lover’s</span>
<i>Mind</i> is in <i>one Place</i>; his <i>Body</i>, in <i>Another</i>; and <i>He</i> himself
is <i>No Where</i>, if he be not with the <i>Object</i> of his
<em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVE</i></em>: So that (in a manner) it transforms the <em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVER</i></em>
into the <i>Object beloved</i>; and all this without any
<i>evident Trouble</i>, or if there be any <i>Trouble</i>, still the <i>Trouble</i>
is <i>lov’d</i>, with apparent Satisfaction and Delight. As
it is ingeniously said, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ubi Amatur, non laboratur; &amp; si
laboratur, labor Amatur</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVE</i></em> always springs and blooms with fresh <i>Desires</i>,
with young and vigorous <i>Inclinations</i>. It is so riveted
in our <i>Natures</i>, that our <i>Blood</i> must first grow
cold and be congeal’d by <i>Death</i>, before this <em class='gesperrt'><i>FLAME</i></em>
can be extinguish’d: Nay, sometimes it is more <i>fervent</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>tho’ of shorter Duration, in our <i>latest Hours</i>, than
in our <i>Prime</i>. For like as the <em class='gesperrt'><i>OIL</i></em> which feeds a <i>Lamp</i>,
when almost spent, the <i>startled Flame</i> begins to rouze itself,
and <i>burn afresh</i>, as if it would fain subsist a <i>little
longer</i>; tho’ on the very <span class='sc'>Dregs</span> of its accustomed Fuel,
it crackles and flashes with greater <i>Noise</i> and <i>Lustre</i> than
before, but presently <i>expires</i>: So does the <i>Amorous Fire</i>,
when we are nearest our <i>Dissolution</i>, begin to trouble
us most, and makes our <span class='sc'>Soul</span> to blaze with greater
<span class='sc'>Fevers</span> of <i>Desire</i> and <i>Grief</i>, knowing its <i>Period</i> to be
near at hand.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVE</i></em> is like the <i>Palm-Tree</i>, the more oppressed
with <i>Weights</i>, the <i>Higher</i> it grows. It always desires to
encrease, dilate, and stretch itself farther still, leading
to an <i>Harmonious Union</i> of <span class='sc'>Hearts</span>. <i>Riches</i> cannot purchase
<i>Love</i>. Neither <i>Threats</i> nor <i>Violence</i> can either
force or restrain it; which being free by <i>Nature</i>, as
proceeding from the <i>Freedom of the Will</i>, disdains all
<span class='sc'>Compulsion</span>; <i>subduing</i> all, and <i>unsubdued</i> by any Opposition.
In short, it is so generous, that whereas all
other <i>Affections</i> and <i>Actions</i> aim at different <i>Rewards</i>;
<em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVE</i></em> only is contented with <i>Love</i>, holding nothing
else as a <i>sufficient Recompence</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVE</i></em> made <i>Ulysses</i>, rather than forsake his dear <i>Penelope</i>,
refuse <em class='gesperrt'><i>IMMORTALITY</i></em> itself at <i>Calipso</i>’s hands.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVE</i></em> is the oldest of our <i>Passions</i>, in that it came
into the World with us; and from thence it becomes
<i>habitual</i> to a <i>good <em class='gesperrt'>NATURE</em></i>, and a <i>brave <em class='gesperrt'>SOUL</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVE</i></em> is the most noble and generous of our
<i>Passions</i>, it soon removes all puny Obstacles in its way.
It is ready, prompt, and dexterous to find <i>Excuses</i> or
<i>Forgiveness</i> for the greatest <em class='gesperrt'><i>FAULTS</i></em>, and much more
to palliate the <i>Peccadillo</i>’s of the <span class='sc'>Beloved</span>. It does by
a peculiar Force and Virtue extirpate all <i>Revenge</i>, and
blot out the <em class='gesperrt'><i>MEMOIRS</i></em> of <i>past Unkindnesses</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVE</i></em> triumphantly <i>overcomes all Things</i>. All
things yield to its Power; and the more we oppose
it, the stronger <i>Resistance</i> it makes. It conquers
the greatest <i>Hearts</i>, and victoriously subdues the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>magnanimous <i>Souls</i>. <i>Alexander</i> the Great, was not
exempted from this insuperable <i>Passion</i>, at the sight
of <i>Darius</i>’s fair <i>Daughters</i>. No, <em class='gesperrt'><i>LOVE</i></em> made <i>Hercules</i>,
the Son of <em class='gesperrt'><i>JUPITER</i></em> himself, stoop and truckle
to the <i>Female Conqueror</i>; according to the following
known <i>Distich</i>,</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Conjunction</i> of both <span class='sc'>Sexes</span>, is the <i>Consummation</i>
of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Love</span></em>, and the <i>Pinnacle</i> of the <i>Lover</i>’s natural
Felicity. It is the Sum and superlative Degree of
their <i>terrene Happiness</i>; above which the <i>Lovers</i> cannot
aspire, naturally speaking, in <i>Human Society</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> is also the utmost <i>Height</i> of their eager Desires,
and the greatest <i>Extent</i> of their languishing
Wishes. It is the <i>Abatement</i>, as well as the <i>Completion</i> of
their unbounded <i>Passions</i>, and the <i>Tranquillity</i> of their
restless <i>Minds</i>. However yet——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <span class='sc'>Act</span> is <i>Two-fold</i>; <i>Fæcund</i> and successful, or
<i>Sterile</i> and unsuccessful in the Event.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the <i>First</i>, some most famous <span class='sc'>Authors</span> have
written their Minds freely and copiously upon it, and
have given certain pertinent <i>Instructions</i>, touching the
<i>Time</i>, and <i>Manner</i>, as well as <i>Conduct</i> of the <i>Parties</i>
concern’d, both before and after the <span class='sc'>Act</span>: Particularly
<i>Avicenna</i><a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c017'><sup>[37]</sup></a> (no <i>Proletarian Writer</i>, but a most Illustrious
and most Learned <i>Prince</i>) has insisted at large upon every
Case belonging to this Head, together with the <i>Way</i> and
<i>Manner</i>, as well as the proper <i>Time</i> of begetting either
<span class='sc'>Sex</span>; <i>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ubi, inquit, menses defluxerint, sitq; abstersus Uterus,
quod quinto ferè die usu venit, aut septimo; Si Vir Mulieri
congrediatur, à primo quàm est purgata die ad quintum,
<em class='gesperrt'>MAREM</em> produci: à quinto verò ad octavum, <em class='gesperrt'>FÆMELLAM</em>:
rursus ab octavo ad duodecimum denuo,
<em class='gesperrt'>MASCULUM</em>, &amp;c.</span>”</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> excellent Opinion is fully proved by <i>Levinus
Lemnius</i> (another great <i>Master</i> of <span class='sc'>Nature</span>): According
to whose authentick Judgment also, there are likewise
many things<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c017'><sup>[38]</sup></a> of an <i>occult specifick Quality</i>, and <i>secret Effect</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>for answering the same <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Ends</span></em>, as well as <i>Fecundity</i>
itself: which both common <i>Reason</i> and daily <i>Experience</i>
confirm for <span class='sc'>Truth</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> because I lie under the Disadvantage (at present)
of writing in our <i>vernacular Tongue</i>, it may be
proper to pass by, what (otherways) might be plentifully
said on this <i>Head</i>: However I shall observe, that
the <i>Generality</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Rules</span></em> are most commonly calculated
for <i>Persons</i> of a discording Constitution of natural <i>Temperaments</i>
and <i>Faculties</i>; which <i>Difference of Constitution</i>
brings often false and ungrounded <i>Reproaches</i> upon the
Reputation of fruitful <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Women</span></em>. From whence it is
justly to be remarked, that, tho’ few or no <i>Children</i> are
got meerly by <span class='sc'>Art</span>; yet if a little <i>Dexterity</i> or ingenious
<i>Subtilty</i> was used with some <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Women</span></em>, there would
not (perhaps) <i>One</i> in <i>Three</i> of those, who are rashly
accounted so, be found <i>BARREN</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the <i>unsuccessful</i> <span class='sc'>Act</span> of <i>Coition</i>, I shall refer
what may be offer’d on <i>that Point</i>, until I come to
treat of <i>Sterility</i>, in <span class='sc'>Section</span> viii: And therefore I shall
only farther observe <i>Here</i>, that the <i>Parties</i> ought not to
encounter with full <i>Stomachs</i>, <i>Bellies</i>, or <i>Bladders</i>; much
less when <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Both</span></em>, or <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Either</span></em>, are <i>weary</i>, <i>fatigu’d</i>, <i>depriv’d
of Sleep</i>, <i>angry</i>, <i>troubled in Mind</i>, or in any other
real respect <i>out of Order</i>. For in these <i>Cases</i>, it is very
detrimental to the Health<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c017'><sup>[39]</sup></a> of such imprudent <i>Parents</i>;
and (if <i>Conception</i> follows) it infallibly <i>intails</i> some respective
<span class='sc'>Evil</span> upon the <i>Innocent Production</i>: Because all
the <i>Affections</i> or <i>Disturbances</i> of their <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Minds</span></em>, virtually
devolve upon the <span class='sc'>Embryo</span>. And besides, as (by such
perverse Means) the <i>Conception</i> becomes <i>irregular</i>; so also
does the <i>Maturation</i>, <i>Nutrition</i>, and <i>Birth</i> carry the
same <i>Impression</i>: For from the least <i>Perturbation</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><i>SPIRIT</i></em>,
the <i>Infant</i> may contract various <i>Blemishes</i> of <span class='sc'>Body</span>,
as well as <i>Errors</i> of <span class='sc'>Mind</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em>, in fine, as this <i>Affair</i> is to be
undertaken with a serene and contented <i>Mind</i>, a chearful
and undisturbed <i>Heart</i>, so it ought to be perform’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>with <i>Moderation</i> and <i>Decency</i>: Not in any <i>brutal Manner</i>
or <i>Posture</i>; but according to the rational <i>Law</i> and proper
<i>Instinct</i> of <i>Nature</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VI.</span><br /> <i>Remarks upon <em class='gesperrt'>COPULATION</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>Supposing</em> now this amicable <i>Engagement</i> of
<span class='sc'>Nature</span> to be over, I may be modestly allow’d (I
hope) to add a few Words upon its necessary <i>Consequences</i>;
and <i>First</i>, of what has happen’d in the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Act</span></em>,
<i>Retention</i>, and <i>Conception</i> following.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em> then, If the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> has contributed most
<i>Seminal Matter</i>, it may reasonably be concluded, that
the <span class='sc'>Child</span> will favour the <span class='sc'>Mother</span> most: If the <span class='sc'>Man</span>
predominantly, the <span class='sc'>Father</span>: If <i>Both</i> equally, it will
resemble <i>Both</i>, or in part the <span class='sc'>Father</span>, and partly the
<span class='sc'>Mother</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> according to <i>Anaxagoras</i>, if the <span class='sc'>Seed</span> has flown
into the <i>Right Side</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, from the Right <i>Rein</i>
of the Man, a <i>Male</i> will be conceiv’d; if into the <i>Left</i>,
from the Left <i>Rein</i>, a <i>Female</i>; by reason of the <i>Frigidity</i>
and <i>Humidity</i> of that Place. Which <i>Notion</i> may
seem <i>probable</i>; considering, that tho’ the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>
has but one <i>Cavity</i>, yet it has two <i>Sinuses</i><a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c017'><sup>[40]</sup></a> for conceiving
the <i>Two different Sexes</i>: As <i>Nature</i> has in other
Respects accordingly given the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> two <i>Breasts</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><i>LACTANTIUS</i></em> also observes<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c017'><sup>[41]</sup></a>, That, if peradventure
a <i>Male</i> should be conceiv’d of the <span class='sc'>Seed</span> fallen to
the <i>left Side</i>, the Place destinated for the <i>Female</i>, he will
make but a <span class='sc'>Semivirile Man</span>; distinguishable by some
<i>Womanish Qualities</i>, such as a <i>weak</i> or <i>tender Heart</i>, <i>small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Voice</i>, a <i>smooth</i>, or <i>unbearded Face</i>, &amp;c: And so, on
the contrary, if a <i>Female</i> should be conceiv’d of the
<span class='sc'>Seed</span> fallen to the <i>right Side</i>, she will have some distinguishable
<i>Marks</i> of <span class='sc'>Virility</span>; such as a <i>large Stature</i>,
<i>robust Members</i>, <i>dusky Colour</i>, <i>rough hairy Face</i>, <i>coarse
Voice</i>, &amp;c: And that because the <i>Conception</i> happen’d
in that Place, which <i>Nature</i> had appropriated to the
<i>Male</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> likewise seems to be the best Reason which
may be given why <i>some Women</i>, like <i>Hector’s</i> <span class='sc'>Wife</span>,
mentioned in <i>Homer’s Iliads</i>, are naturally inclin’d to
intermeddle with <span class='sc'>Men’s</span> <i>Affairs</i>; for having thus (as
it were) <i>originally</i> invaded his <span class='sc'>Right</span> <i>ex traduce</i>, they
are always for maintaining their <i>wrong Conquests</i>, and
defending their <i>unjust Possessions</i> in future Progress of
Time.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> I should rather in this Topick agree with
<i>Velthuysius</i><a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c017'><sup>[42]</sup></a>, that <i>Both</i> <span class='sc'>Seeds</span> are each of them naturally
endued with the <i>Faculty</i> of generating its <i>Like</i>: I mean,
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Man’s</span></em>, to produce a <i>Male</i>; and the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Woman’s</span></em>, a
<i>Female</i>: And that therefore by a natural <i>Predominancy</i>,
where the <i>Masculine Faculty</i> has prevail’d, a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Man-Child</span></em>
is begot; and a <span class='sc'>Girl</span>, where the <i>Feminine Virtue</i>
has exceeded it.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em>, in short, is the best and only Reason I
know, why <i>Children</i> like to either <i>Parent</i> in <span class='sc'>Sex</span>, may
yet differ in <i>Physiognomy</i>, <i>Manners</i>, &amp;c: the <span class='sc'>Seed</span> of
the <i>one</i> perhaps prevailing in <i>making</i> the <span class='sc'>Sex</span>, and That
of the <i>other</i>, in <i>determining</i> the rest of the Parts.
Hence it is, in all Probability, that a <span class='sc'>Child</span> like his
<i>Father</i> in <span class='sc'>Sex</span>, may be like his <i>Mother</i> in natural <i>Disposition</i>
and Tenderness of <i>Constitution</i>. Although by the
way (without doubt) the <i>Place</i> or <i>Sinus</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
<i>Matter</i>, <i>Heat</i>, and <i>Imagination</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Woman</span></em>, contribute
very much to the <i>Difference</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sex</em></span>; as will
hereafter more plainly appear at large.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em>, in fine, <i>This</i> is the only <i>Cause</i> of the <i>Conception</i>
of <span class='sc'>Hermaphrodites</span>, that the emitted <i>Substance</i> of
<span class='sc'>Both Parents</span> containing the full respective <i>Faculty</i>
of <span class='sc'>Each</span>, is sufficiently prolifick and prevalent to constitute
and distinguish each proper <span class='sc'>Sex</span>, in one and the
same <i>personal Production</i>. But before I proceed farther
on the <i>Similitude of Children</i>, I beg leave previously to
describe the <i>Force</i> of <i>IMAGINATION</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VII.</span><br /> <i>Of the Power of the <em class='gesperrt'>IMAGINATIVE FACULTY</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Imagination</i> is the strongest and most efficacious
of all the <span class='sc'>Senses</span>; for the <i>Vivacity</i> of all the
<i>others</i> (mention’d in Sect. I. Chap. 5.) in some measure,
depend upon it.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> works upon, and affects, <i>others</i> as well as <i>ourselves</i>,
and operates in the very <i>Soul</i>, as well as <i>Body</i>
of Man; moving the Powers of all the <i>Passions</i> of the
Mind.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> it happens frequently by reason of the <i>Similitude</i>
of things; that by <i>seeing</i> or <i>imagining</i> <span class='sc'>One</span> to eat some
sharp or sour Matter, or <i>hearing</i> it only mention’d,
<span class='sc'>Another’s</span> <i>Teeth</i> may be set on edge, and his <i>Tongue</i>
wax tart; so by seeing <i>One</i> gape, <i>Another</i> often falls a
yawning. In like manner, as the <i>sight</i> of any <i>filthy</i>
Thing causeth <i>Nauseousness</i>; so the <i>sight</i> of Man’s <i>Blood</i>,
makes many Persons fall a-swooning.</p>

<p class='c005'><i><em class='gesperrt'>GUILLAUME</em> de Paris</i> writes, that he saw a Man,
who at the <i>SIGHT</i> of a <i>Medicine</i>, went to <i>Stool</i> as oft
as he pleas’d, tho’ it neither in <i>Substance</i>, <i>Odour</i>, or
<i>Taste</i>, did affect him; but only by an <i>Apprehension</i> of a
kind of <i>Resemblance</i>. Which is much the same Case of
one in a <i>Dream</i>, who thinks he <i>burns</i> and is in a <i>Fire</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>or as much tormented, as if he did <i>really burn</i>, tho’
far enough from any Substance of <i>Fire</i>; only because
of a <i>Resemblance</i> apprehended by the Strength of <i>IMAGINATION</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> besides, this <i>IMAGINATION</i> hath not only
such Power over the <i>Body</i>, but also over the very <i>Soul</i>
of Man; which Power of the <i>Soul</i>, hath its respective
<i>Influence</i> upon the <i>Body</i>: As <i>Avicen</i> remarkably describes
a certain <i>Man</i>, who (when he pleas’d) could
affect his <i>Body</i> with the <span class='sc'>Palsy</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is wonderfully related of <i>Gallus Vibius</i>, that he
became <i>Mad</i>, not casually, but on purpose; for whilst
he imitated Mad-Men, he so assimilated their <i>Madness</i>
to himself by the <i>Counterfeit</i>, that he fell at last into <i>real</i>
<span class='sc'>Madness</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>St.</span></em> <i>AUSTIN</i> mentions <i>some Men</i>, who could move
their <i>Ears</i>; and <i>others</i> who could move the <i>Crown</i> of
their Heads to their <i>Foreheads</i>, and <i>replace</i> them at
Pleasure. He writes of <i>Another</i> also, who could sweat
whenever he had a mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have likewise known some <i>Persons</i> myself, who
could weep and shed abundance of <i>Tears</i> at Will and
Pleasure; <i>others</i>, who could bring up what they had
<i>swallow’d</i> of any kind, as <i>Gold</i>, <i>Silver</i>, &amp;c; and <i>others</i>
again, who could so naturally <i>imitate</i> and express the
<span class='sc'>Voices</span> of <i>Birds</i>, <i>Cattle</i>, <i>Dogs</i>, &amp;c; that they could not
easily be distinguished.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>YEA</em>, and farther yet, many <i>Learned Authors</i><a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c017'><sup>[43]</sup></a> testify
by divers Examples (of <i>Cajetava</i>, <i>Æmilia</i>, &amp;c.) that
<i>Women</i> have been turn’d into <i>Men</i>: Which some would
persuade us to believe, to be an <i>Effect</i> of the Force of
a vehement <em class='gesperrt'><i>IMAGINATION</i></em>, acting upon the <i>Soul</i>,
with which it is of a near <i>Affinity</i>, beyond all the Power
of <span class='sc'>Sense</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to this Point, I am no ways to question the <i>Veracity</i>
of what so many excellent Men have confirmed;
but (granting it to be so) I think we may find more
probable <i>Reasons</i> for it, than all the <i>Powers</i> of <i>IMAGINATION</i>,
how great soever and marvellous they may
be: Whereof I shall mention <i>That</i>, which seems to be
the most <i>rational Cause</i>; viz. An extinguish’d or latent
<i>forming Faculty</i><a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c017'><sup>[44]</sup></a>, which (however) sometimes has <i>exerted</i>
itself again, like the <span class='sc'>Blazing</span> of a raked or resuscitated
<i>Fire</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> as our <i>Teeth</i> take their Beginning <i>in</i> the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>, but are perfected <i>without</i>, as <i>Bartholomæus
Eustachius</i> teacheth; and as the <i>Teeth</i>, call’d <i>Dentes sapientiæ</i>,
are generated, and break out, even after the
30th Year of our Age: So it may be, that the <i>virile
Genitals</i> have been imperfectly begun in the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and
that this <i>forming Faculty</i> has only perfected them by little
and little; so that at last they have sprung forth and
appear’d, after shaking off the <i>Pudendum</i>. And consequently
such <span class='sc'>Women</span> as <i>Those</i> (upon <i>Dancing-Bouts</i>, or
the like, when the <i>Blood</i> and <i>natural Heat</i> had been
strongly exagitated) have turned into <span class='sc'>Men</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> <i>That</i> be, I very well know that
when the <i>Soul</i> is elevated and inflam’d with a fervent
<i>IMAGINATION</i>, it may not only <i>affect</i> its own proper
<i>Body</i>, but also <i>That</i> of <span class='sc'>Another</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> the <i>Longing</i> of a <i>Woman</i> that has conceiv’d,
acts apparently upon <i>Another’s Body</i>, when it <i>marks</i> the
<i>Infant</i> in her <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em> with the <i>Figure</i> or <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Mark</span></em> of the
<i>Thing long’d for</i>: Besides, who knows not that <i>one Body</i>
may be easily affected with the <i>Vapours</i> of <i>another</i> diseased
Body? As is plain in Cases of <i>Plague</i>, <i>Leprosy</i>,
and several other <i>Distempers</i>. Thus also in the
<i>Effluvia’s</i> or <i>Vapours</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Eyes</span></em>, there is so great
a <i>Power</i>, that they can bewitch and infect the
<i>Beholders</i> about them; as the monstrous <i>Catoblepas</i>, and
<i>Cockatrice</i> or <i>Basilisk</i>, kill People with their very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span><i>Looks</i><a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c017'><sup>[45]</sup></a>. So in like manner <i>Witches</i> by their intent
Desire to <i>hurt</i>, have been thought to bewitch Persons
most perniciously by their steady malicious <i>Looks</i> only,
directed and inforc’d by <i>IMAGINATION</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> this Force of <em class='gesperrt'><i>IMAGINATION</i></em> affecting
other <i>Bodies</i>, holds good even among <i>Brute-Creatures</i>;
as One bit by a <i>Mad Dog</i>, presently falls a-raging, and
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Likeness</span></em> of <i>Dogs</i> is clearly impressed upon his
<i>Urine</i>. Moreover, by <i>IMAGINATION</i> in time of <i>copulating</i>,
<span class='sc'>Peacocks</span> and other <i>Birds</i>, impress a particular
<i>Colour</i> upon the <i>Wings</i>, &amp;c. of their Brood; and from hence
it is, that the Curious may have store of <i>white young-ones</i>,
by hanging the <i>Places</i> where they <i>couple</i> with
white <i>Linnen-Cloths</i>, <i>Papers</i>, &amp;c: As in <i>Snowy</i> Mountainous
Countries we find always <i>white Peacocks</i>, <i>Quails</i>,
<i>Wolves</i>, <i>Hares</i>, and other <i>Creatures</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> <i>This</i> holy <span class='sc'>Jacob</span><a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c017'><sup>[46]</sup></a> was not ignorant of, when
he used that ingenious subtile <i>Stratagem</i> of placing <i>white-streaked
Rods</i> before <span class='sc'>Laban’s</span> <i>Flocks</i>; which also answer’d
effectually, in the <i>Cattle</i>’s producing their <i>speckled and
white spotted Young</i>. In like manner by the same <i>Experiment</i>,
the curious Admirers may be supply’d with
Variety of <i>spotted Birds</i>, <i>speckled Horses</i>, <i>Dogs</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Mind</i> also being inflam’d with a vehement
<i>IMAGINATION</i>, may affect both the <i>Soul</i> and <i>Body</i> of
<span class='sc'>Another</span>: Which we need not wonder at, considering
how much more powerful, fervent, and prevalent the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Mind</span></em> is in its <i>Motion</i>, than any exhaling <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Vapours</span></em>;
and that it does not want its proper and peculiar <i>Mediums</i>
by which it may operate.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> (I think) is also evidently shewn from the
many <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Miracles</span></em>, which we find have been done by
<i>Prophets</i>, <i>Apostles</i>, and other <i>Holy Men</i>; (not to mention
those <i>Wonders</i> of <i>Pythagoras</i>, <i>Apollonius</i>, <i>Empedocles</i>, &amp;c.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>which cannot come in Competition with the <i>Others</i>,
being ascrib’d to <i>Natural Causes</i>): Whose <i>Minds</i> being
firmly fix’d upon <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, with full Intent for <i>Good</i>,
affected both the <span class='sc'>Souls</span> and <span class='sc'>Bodies</span> of <i>others</i>, as well as
<i>Themselves</i>, with what <i>Divine Gifts</i>, or other <i>Blessings</i>,
they wanted.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> it is that <i>Philosophers</i> advise, to shun the
<i>Society</i> of wicked and impious Men; because their <i>Souls</i>,
being full (as it were) of pernicious <i>Rays</i>, infect them
who are <i>near</i>, with a <i>resembling Contagion</i>: As they enjoin
likewise on the other hand, to keep and frequent
the <i>Fellowship</i> of good and fortunate Men; because (by
such a <i>Proximity</i>) they are diffusive of their own <i>Good</i>,
and infuse it into <i>Those</i> about them. For as <span class='sc'>Bad</span> of
something <i>bad</i>, so <span class='sc'>Good</span> of something <i>good</i>, always descends
and adheres to the <i>nighest</i>; which virtually (like
the <i>Smell of Musk</i>, or <i>Assa-Fœtida</i>) continues a long
time its lasting <i>Impression</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HERE</em> might be indeed a great deal said upon the
<span class='sc'>Efficacy</span> of the <i>Constancy of the Mind</i>; but because I’ve
already been too prolix on this <i>Head</i>, I shall only observe,
that in all our <i>Business</i> and <i>Applications</i>, a strong
<i>IMAGINATION</i>, zealous <i>Affection</i>, firm <i>Hope</i>, and
stedfast <i>Belief</i>, are great Advantages, and necessary
Helps. As some most excellent <i>Physicians</i> have experimentally
verified this Notion, that a strong <i>Belief</i>, and
constant <i>Hope</i>, together with the <i>Love</i> and <i>Confidence</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Patient</span> towards the <i>Physician</i>, conduce very much
to the Recovery of <i>Health</i>, and sometimes perhaps
more than the <i>Medicine</i> itself: Because the firm <i>IMAGINATION</i>
of the honest <i>Physician</i> concurring (in effect)
with the <i>Medicine</i>, and strongly hoping it will do
him <i>Good</i>, he thereby influentially changes the <i>Symptoms</i>,
and virtually alters the <i>Qualities</i> in the <i>Body</i> of the <i>Sick</i>;
especially if the <span class='sc'>Patient</span> reposes an <i>entire Confidence</i> in
him, by which means he becomes mutually disposed to
receive the <span class='sc'>Virtue</span> of the <i>Physician</i>, as well as <i>That</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Physick</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em><a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c017'><sup>[47]</sup></a><i>Arabian Philosophers</i> join’d in this Opinion,
establishing it for a <i>Fundamental Maxim</i> among them;
that <i>whatever the constant Mind</i> affected <i>with a fervent
Desire</i>, <i>would be</i> effected: As in the Case of the MIND
of <i>Him</i>, who is vehemently in <i>Love</i>, whatever it <i>affects</i>,
has an <i>Efficacy</i> to cause <span class='sc'>Love</span>; and so in other such like
Cases.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> however, to come closer to the <i>IMAGINATION</i>
of the Pregnant <i>Woman</i>, who knows not that it
<i>affects</i> the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> in the <i>Womb</i>? Whence is it then that
we have so many <i>deform’d Persons</i>, <i>crooked Bodies</i>, <i>ugly
Aspects</i>, <i>distorted Mouths</i>, <i>wry Noses</i>, and the like, in all
Countries; but from the <i>IMAGINATION</i> of the <i>Mother</i>;
while she either conceives such shapeless <i>Phantasms</i>
in her <i>Mind</i>, or while she frequently and intently
fixes her <i>Eyes</i> upon such <i>deform’d Persons</i> or disagreeable
<em class='gesperrt'><i>OBJECTS</i></em>? Wherefore it is very wrong, and highly
imprudent in <i>Women</i> that have conceived, to please
themselves so much in playing with <i>Dogs</i>, <i>Squirrels</i>,
<i>Apes</i>, &amp;c. carrying them in their <i>Laps</i> or <i>Bosoms</i>, and
feeding, kissing, or hugging them, as I have both often
heard, and seen with my own Eyes.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> besides, the same is the Case, when the
<i>Natural Faculties</i> are all at work in <i>forming</i>, or ripening
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Fœtus</span></em>; for if the <i>Woman</i> be <i>surpriz’d</i> at any sudden
Evil, or <i>frighted</i> at any unseemly Sight, the <i>Humours</i>
and <i>Spirits</i> presently retire downwards, and (as it
were) abscond themselves in the <i>Recess</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>:
From whence immediately a strong <i>IMAGINATION</i> of
the disagreeable <i>Thing</i> (whether <i>seen</i> or <i>heard</i> only)
seizes her <i>Mind</i>; and the <i>Forming Faculty</i> (going on in
the <i>Interim</i>) quickly impresses the <i>Imaginary Idea</i> of <i>That</i>
thing heard off, or the <i>Shape</i> and <i>Form</i> of <i>That</i> thing
seen, upon the <span class='sc'>Fœtus</span>. The same is the <i>Reason</i>, that
if a <i>Mouse</i>, <i>Rat</i>, <i>Weazel</i>, <i>Cat</i>, or the like, leaps suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>upon a <i>Woman</i> that has conceived, or if an <i>Apple</i>,
<i>Pear</i>, <i>Plum</i>, <i>Cherry</i>, &amp;c. fall upon any part of her
<i>Body</i>; the <em class='gesperrt'><i>MARK</i></em> of the thing (be what it will) is
instantly <i>imprinted</i>, and will manifestly appear on the
same <i>Part</i>, or <i>Member</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i>: unless the <i>Woman</i>
(in that very Moment) wipe <i>That Part</i> or <i>Member</i>,
and move her <i>Hand</i> to some more remote, private, or
convenient <i>Place</i> of the <i>Body</i>: which done, the <i>MARK</i>
is actually averted, or at least stamped upon the <i>other
Part</i> touch’d, where the deep <i>Impression</i> of the <i>Mind</i>,
directs, and fixes the <i>IMAGINATION</i>; and whither
the <i>Forming Faculty</i> (not so much by any <i>Virtue</i> of the
simple <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, as by <i>Force</i> of the strong <i>IMAGINATION</i>)
infallibly converts it.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> fine, having thus briefly defin’d, and variously
described the <i>Powers</i> of <i>IMAGINATION</i>, I come in the
next Place, more particularly, to treat of the Reasons
of <span class='sc'>Similitude</span> in <i>Children</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP</em>. VIII.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>SIMILITUDE</em> of Children.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>WHATEVER</em> may be advanced on this <i>Head</i>,
the most probable and solid Reason for the
<i>Child</i>’s <i>Likeness</i> or <i>Resemblance</i>, is the <i>IMAGINATION</i>
of the <i>Mother</i> in the <span class='sc'>Act</span> of <i>Copulation</i>; together with
the <i>Liberty</i> she gives herself in her <i>Thoughts</i> and <i>Actions</i>,
during the Time of <i>Formation</i>, commonly call’d the
Time of <i>Breeding</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> it is, that whatever she intentively fixes
her <i>Eyes</i> upon, or <i>conceives</i> and <i>impresses</i> in her Mind,
the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> represents the same in its <i>extimous Parts</i>:
And particularly whatever <span class='sc'>Object</span> she directs her <i>Eyes</i>
or <i>Thoughts</i> upon, in the Interval between the <i>Embrace</i>
and the <i>Charm</i>, its <i>Effigies</i> is afterwards manifest in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span><span class='sc'>Child</span>. As St. <i>Jerom</i> thus relates of a certain <i>Woman</i>,
who conceiv’d and brought forth a <i>Black-Child</i>, tho’
both <i>She</i> and her <i>Husband</i> (the real Father) were <i>white</i>;
meerly by eying a <i>PICTURE</i> in the Bed-Chamber at
that <i>critical Juncture</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> this Chapter<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c017'><sup>[48]</sup></a><i>Pliny</i> has most elegantly
express’d the <i>Artifice</i> of <span class='sc'>Nature</span>, together with all the
<i>Reasons</i> and <i>Causes</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Similitude</span></em>, to this Purpose;
<i>viz.</i> “<i>The Cogitations of the Mind make much for the</i>
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Similitudes</span></em> and <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Resemblances</span></em> <i>of Children:
As many other accidental Occurrences are thought to
be very efficacious in the same, and that whether they
come by</i> Sight, Hearing, <i>or calling to</i> Remembrance;
<i>or by</i> Imaginations <i>conceiv’d, and deeply apprehended
in the very Act of</i> Generation, <i>or the very Instant
of</i> Conception: <i>The inconstant</i> Mind, <i>and wandering</i>
Thought, <i>of either</i> Parent, <i>is justly suppos’d to be
one</i> Cause.”</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> it is, that some <i>Children</i> favour and resemble
their <i>Fathers</i>, some their <i>Mothers</i>, some their
<i>Grandfathers</i>, or <i>Mothers</i>, and some their <i>Kinsmen</i>: And
hence also it is, that there is more Difference and Diversity
in the <i>Rational Kind</i>, than in all <i>other Creatures</i>; because
the Velocity of their <i>Thoughts</i>, the Celerity of their
<i>Minds</i>, and the Variety of their <i>Dispositions</i>, impress a
far greater <i>Diversity</i> of various peculiar <em class='gesperrt'><i>MARKS</i></em>:
While the rest of <i>irrational Creatures</i> have their <i>Minds</i>
continually fixed (in a manner) immoveable, steady, and
alike: every <i>One</i> of them in its own peculiar Kind, and
specifick Nature.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>INSOMUCH</em> that the <i>Woman’s</i> <em class='gesperrt'><i>IMAGINATION</i></em>
frequently induces a strange <i>Likeness</i> to her
<span class='sc'>Infant</span>; that is, in no Part, and in no Respect, favouring
the <span class='sc'>Father</span>. From whence it often happens,
that a <i>Woman</i> abusing her <span class='sc'>Husband</span>’<i>s</i> Bed, and fearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>perhaps to be surpriz’d by him in the <i>ACT</i>, brings
forth (in due time) her <i>CHILD</i>, no ways <i>resembling</i> the
<i>real</i> <span class='sc'>Father</span>, (namely the <span class='sc'>Gallant</span>); but altogether
<i>LIKE</i> to the <i>injur’d</i> <span class='sc'>Husband</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, as to what relates to the <i>Tempers</i>,
<i>Dispositions</i>, <i>Miens</i>, <i>Manners</i>, <i>Qualities</i>, and <i>Propensions</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Mind</span>, daily <i>Examples</i> convince us, that <i>Children</i>,
after all, generally much resemble <i>Those</i> of their <i>Progenitors</i>;
which proceeds merely from the <i>Efficacy</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Seed</span>, containing the Power of the natural <i>Faculties</i> of
their Minds and <i>vital Spirits</i>, which are thence infus’d
into their <i>Posterity</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> I take this <i>Matter</i> to depend much upon the
<i>Passion</i>, <i>Indolence</i>, or <i>Indifferency</i> of the Mind, with
which the <span class='sc'>Act</span> of <i>Copulation</i> is perform’d. For as the
<i>Ardour</i> and <i>Fervency</i> of the <i>Parents</i>, and their plentiful
prolifick <i>Contribution</i>, tend much to the <i>CHILD’s</i> affecting
the same <i>Behaviour</i>, <i>Gestures</i>, <i>Actions</i>, <i>Tempers</i>, and
<i>Motions</i> of <span class='sc'>Body</span> and <span class='sc'>Mind</span>; even sometimes to their
representing the very <i>Nature</i>, and treading the very
<i>Foot-Steps</i> of their <span class='sc'>Parents</span>, to so nice a degree, of an
exact Resemblance, that I’ve more than once observed
a <span class='sc'>Mole-Mark</span> of a <i>Father</i> plainly impress’d on his
<i>Child</i>. Which, I think, is also conformable to<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c017'><sup>[49]</sup></a> <i>Horace</i>’s
Meaning;</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> because the <i>Institution of Nature</i>, perfects its

<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span><i>Errors</i>, and abolishes <i>Blemishes</i>; the <i>Poet</i> very pertinently

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em>, however yet, there are many <i>Parents</i> still less
salacious and less fervid; who rather vilify, than covet,
and rather abstain from, than delight themselves in
this <i>Encounter</i>. In short, there are some of both Sexes,
who, in patiently gratifying their active <i>Consorts</i>, esteem
it rather a sort of <i>Hardship</i> and <i>TASK</i> for <i>Family-Quiet</i>,
than any incumbent <i>DUTY</i> of <i>Nuptial Benevolence</i>;
Which<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c017'><sup>[50]</sup></a>St. <i>Paul</i> seems to allude to, by calling it the
<i>defrauding of one the other</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> hence it is, that <i>Children</i> often degenerate
from the <i>Nature</i> and <i>Qualities</i> of their <span class='sc'>Parents</span>; from
hence also it is, that <i>brisk Men</i> sometimes have <i>stupid</i>,
and <i>wise Men</i> frequently beget <i>foolish Children</i>. This
happens only because of the <i>Indifferency</i>, <i>Indolence</i>, or
<i>Coldness</i>, either of Mind or Constitution, in their <i>Conjugal
Pleasures</i>: The dull heavy <i>Faculty</i> of their <i>Inclinations</i>
to the <span class='sc'>Act</span>, being diffus’d and transmitted through
the <span class='sc'>Seed</span> into the <i>Infant</i>, according to <i>Catullus</i>;</p>

      <div class='line'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Naturæ sequitur semina quisque suæ.</span></i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> farther still, the <span class='sc'>Seed</span> flowing from the <i>principal
Parts</i> of the Body, comprehends in itself the <i>Vigour</i>
and <i>Quality</i> of their respective Members: Whence
it follows, that <i>Diseases</i>, <i>Imperfections</i>, <i>Blemishes</i>, or any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>other <i>Deformity</i>, inherent in any <i>Part</i> of the <span class='sc'>Parents</span>,
becomes commonly <i>hereditary</i> to their <span class='sc'>Children</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> is the Case of the whole Dutchy of upper
<i>Styria</i>, where all the <i>Natives</i> have a huge <i>Excrescence</i>
of <span class='sc'>Flesh</span>, which grows up with the <i>Body</i> (however
visibly increasing and decreasing with the <span class='sc'>Moon</span>) generally
lying upon the Left side from the <i>Jaw-bone</i>,
and hanging downwards: So that the <i>Women</i> giving
<span class='sc'>Suck</span> of that <i>Breast</i>, commonly cast this <i>carnous Excrescence</i>
(which they call <span class='sc'>Crape</span>) over their Shoulders.
This is so <i>Natural</i> to them, and remarkable, that in a
Journey once from <i>Venice</i> to <i>Vienna</i>, passing thro’ the
chief Town of that Country, call’d <i>Judenburg</i>, I had
the Curiosity to go off the <i>Post-Waggon</i>, into the <i>Church</i>,
with five other Gentlemen, Fellow-Passengers, to be
better satisfy’d of the Truth of it. The <i>People</i> were
at <span class='sc'>Mass</span>, but the sight of us soon confounded, or at
least disturb’d their <i>Devotion</i>; for in a Moment, the
Eyes of the whole <i>Congregation</i> were staring upon us,
wondering to see so many <i>deform’d Men</i> (as they call’d
us) in that Place at one Time.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> the same is the only Reason, that most
<i>Children</i> in <i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i>, are born with some <span class='sc'>Symptoms</span>
of the <i>Venereal Disease</i>; which, however, is without
any infectious <i>Malignity</i>, and so <i>Natural</i> to them, that
they seldom apply to the <i>Doctor</i> for <span class='sc'>Cure</span>, until the Case
becomes more dangerous or desperate by the <i>Party’s</i>
own Means: which generally happens to them in a very
few Years, being exceedingly <i>Salacious</i> from their <span class='sc'>Infancy</span>,
because of the stimulating <i>Acrimony</i> of the <i>putrid
Humours</i> of the Body, which they only strive to mitigate,
or allay, by <i>continual</i> <span class='sc'>Whoring</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> what’s already said, we see that the
<i>Efficacy</i> of the <i>Father’s</i> <span class='sc'>Seed</span> is very considerable; insomuch,
that indeed many calamitous <i>Misfortunes</i> may
derive from it, to his <i>Posterity</i>: But it is, however, to
be strictly observ’d, that what <i>Disorder</i> soever of a vitious
Nature derives itself this way from the <i>Mother</i>,
hath yet the greater <i>Malignity</i>, and more powerful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span><i>Effect</i> upon her <i>CHILDREN</i><a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c017'><sup>[51]</sup></a>; the <i>Habits</i> of her Body,
Good or Bad, her <i>Virtues</i> or <i>Vices</i>, taking still a deeper
<i>Root</i>, or firmer <i>Footing</i> in the Constitution of the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span>.
Which <i>Distinction</i>, in short, must needs be a most plain
<i>Case</i>, considering that the <i>Maternal Blood</i> is its chief
<span class='sc'>Aliment</span>, and the very <i>secundary ORIGIN</i> of its <i>Procreation</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> this, in fine, is the only <i>natural Reason</i> to be
given, why many <i>Things</i>, no ways commendable in
either <span class='sc'>Sex</span>, are the less excusable in the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>.</p>

<em class='gesperrt'>CONCEPTION</em>, in a word, is <i>Two-fold</i>;
True and <i>Natural</i>, or False and <i>Præternatural</i>.
It is call’d <i>True</i>, in opposition
to a <i>False Conception</i>; and <i>Natural</i>, because
it answers to the <i>Institution of Nature</i>.
Wherefore I shall begin with <i>This</i>, and
conduct the <i>Woman</i>, who has truly and naturally <i>conceiv’d</i>,
thro’ the different <i>Stages</i> of Life she is to pass;
describing plainly, and laying before her the many
various <i>Scenes</i> of every respective <i>Stage</i>, which can any
ways affect her Person.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this nice Affair, like a faithful <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Pilot</span></em>, in a

treat of the different <i>Preternatural Conceptions</i>; as I shall in
this place now discourse only of the <i>Natural</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Natural Conception</i> then, is the first principal
<i>Action</i>, and peculiar <i>Function</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, in duly
commixing and fomenting the retain’d <span class='sc'>Seeds</span> of <i>Man</i>

<span class='sc'>Seed</span> be retain’d <i>seven Hours</i>, the <i>Woman</i> hath <span class='sc'>Conceiv’d</span>:
Neither can I find sufficient Reason to think
<i>Nature</i> one Moment <i>Idle</i>, much less <i>seven Days</i>. Therefore
<i>CONCEPTION</i> ought to be reckoned, from the
very <i>Day</i><a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c017'><sup>[53]</sup></a> of the <i>First Retention</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet, it is certain that, if the <i>Debility</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Seed</span>, or <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, or <i>Both</i>, happen to hinder
or impugn the Work, <i>Nature</i> ejects the <span class='sc'>Genitura</span>, or
<i>Thing conceiv’d</i>, on the <i>seventh</i> Day; which Time is the
common <i>Crisis</i> of all <i>Diseases</i>, and <i>Morbifick Accidents</i>:
Whereas if no such <i>Effluxion</i> happens about that Time,
<i>CONCEPTION</i><a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c017'><sup>[54]</sup></a> is certain, and <i>Formation</i> goes on.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>True CONCEPTION</i> is likewise known by
many various <i>Signs</i>; whereof I shall mention a <i>Few</i>,
not out of any vain Curiosity, but meer Necessity:
Because, supposing a <i>Woman</i> to labour under any dangerous
<i>acute Disease</i>, it is of the greatest <i>Importance</i>, to
be certain, whether she hath conceiv’d, or not; by
reason that the Means of her <i>future Relief</i> must (of
Necessity) be adapted to her <i>present Condition</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> II.</span><br /> <i>Of the Signs of <em class='gesperrt'>CONCEPTION</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Signs</i> of <span class='sc'>Conception</span> are many and various,
and accordingly some more, some less <i>certain</i>, as
hereafter set forth; whereof I shall only mention such
as are most common and familiar to the <i>Generality</i> of
<span class='sc'>Women</span>: <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Retention</i> or <i>Suppression</i> of the <span class='sc'>Menstrua</span>;
when not occasion’d by some other <i>Indisposition</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>SUDDEN</em> <i>Weakness</i>, <i>Feebleness</i>, and <i>Imbecility</i>
of the Body and Limbs.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>LAZINESS</em>, <i>Weariness</i>, and <i>Sleepiness</i>, with
a <i>Heaviness</i> of the whole Body; but especially of the
<i>Reins</i> and the <i>Thighs</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. A sort of little <span class='sc'>Spots</span>, or hard <span class='sc'>Warts</span>, arising
in the <i>Face</i> and <i>Forehead</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. A small <i>Pain</i> about the <span class='sc'>Navel</span>, and <i>Commotions</i> in
the <i>lower</i> <span class='sc'>Belly</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>COLD</em> Shivering, and trembling <i>Fits</i>; wandring
<i>Pains</i>, and <i>Head-Aches</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. <em class='gesperrt'>LOSS</em> of wonted <i>Colour</i>, sunk <i>Eyes</i>, discolour’d
<i>Eye-Balls</i>: A sparkling <i>Dimness</i>, and <i>Glimmering</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Eyes</span>; the <i>Ball</i> growing less, and the <i>White</i>
larger.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. A <i>Protuberancy</i> or Swelling of the <span class='sc'>Veins</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Breasts</span>; their growing <i>Hard</i>, and giving <i>Pain</i>: As
the <span class='sc'>Nipples</span> become firm, large, and dark-colour’d,
with a <i>livid Circle</i> around them.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> and many other <i>Signs</i> often occur upon
<i>CONCEPTION</i>; but except a <i>Plurality</i> of them meet
in <i>one Person</i>, they are not absolutely to be rely’d on:
It being a <i>Vulgar Error</i> among <i>Women</i>, to calculate
precisely from the Time of <i>missing</i> their <span class='sc'>Months</span>; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>as <i>These</i> are often suppress’d, without any such manifest
<i>Cause</i>; so I have known some <i>Plethorick</i> Persons, who have
had them several repeated times after Conception.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>YEA</em>, I was once given to understand by a
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Lady</span></em> of Distinction, in the City of <i>Berlin</i>, that she
never had <i>Them</i>, till she first <i>conceiv’d</i> in the 19th
Year of her Age; and then they came in <i>regular Course</i>,
without any <i>Detriment</i>, during the whole <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Foetura</span></em>,
or time of <i>Gestation</i>: After which, she had <i>Them</i> no
more, till she <i>conceiv’d</i> again, when <i>They</i> return’d, and
continued as formerly; and thus it constantly happen’d
to her, till she had done <i>Child-bearing</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THERE</em> are <i>other</i> more certain <i>Signs</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><i>CONCEPTION</i></em>;
touching which, let it suffice, that the
<i>Physician</i> knows them, from the <i>Relation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Patient</span>:
And to these may be added the <i>Symptoms</i> of the
<em class='gesperrt'><i>MONTHS</i></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> notwithstanding all the positive <i>Diagnosticks</i>,
which most Men have been, hitherto, guided by; I
have met with so many <i>Fallibilities</i> in this Point, that
I shou’d readily have come into the Opinion of<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c017'><sup>[55]</sup></a>
<i>Paulus Sacchias</i>, and deny’d the <i>Certainty</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><i>PREGNANCY</i></em>,
even at an <i>advanc’d Time</i>, had I not been
better instructed by Those most excellent <i>Physicians</i> and
<span class='sc'>Men-Midwives</span>, Sig. <i>Garofanzzo</i> of <i>Padua</i>, and <i>Pfizerus</i>
of <i>Wittenberg</i>; who agree in certain <i>infallible Signs</i>,
which put an end to all my <i>Doubts</i>, as well as to the
grand <i>Controversy</i>, touching <em class='gesperrt'><i>CONCEPTION</i></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to those common <i>Signs</i>, which discover the
<i>CONCEPTION</i> of a <i>Boy</i> from a <i>Girl</i>, or <i>Vice Versa</i>; finding
<i>them</i> tend only to <i>Curiosity</i>, and to no real <i>Advantage</i>,
I cannot think it worth while to allow them any Place
<i>Here</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> III.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>DIET</em> and <em class='gesperrt'>REGIMEN</em> of the Pregnant Woman.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>I Come now, agreeable to my Promise, in the <i>First
Chapter</i> of this <span class='sc'>Section</span>, to direct and prescribe to
the <i>Woman conceiv’d</i> her due <span class='sc'>Course</span>: Whom I would
have to consider, <i>First</i>, that she is in a very narrow and
dangerous <span class='sc'>Sea</span>; and, <i>Secondly</i>, that, as the <span class='sc'>Pilot</span> cannot
be always upon the <i>Watch</i>; so the Safety of <span class='sc'>Ship</span> and
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Cargo</span></em> depends entirely upon the <i>Care</i>, <i>Conduct</i>, and
<i>Steady Hand</i> of the skilful <span class='sc'>Steersman</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> the <i>Woman</i> being now satisfy’d
of her <i>CONCEPTION</i>, she is to observe a quite different
<i>Oeconomy</i> in her <i>Way of Living</i>, from what she
formerly practis’d: Since a <i>double Mischief</i> may be the
Result of one <i>single Fault</i> in this Case; the <i>INFANT</i>
always participating of what affects the <em class='gesperrt'><i>MOTHER</i></em>.
And therefore she is now not only to take Care of
<i>Herself</i>, but also of her <i>Embryo</i>, or the <i>Fruit</i> of her
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>; especially in the <i>First Months</i>, when it may be
justly compared to the tender <span class='sc'>Blossoms</span> of <i>Trees</i>, which
are easily <i>blasted</i>, or <i>shaken-off</i> by the least Accident of
<i>Wind</i> or <i>Rain</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Regimen</i>, which I am about to speak of, is
<i>Two-fold</i>; the <i>One</i> for such <i>Women</i> as find themselves in
a good <i>State of Health</i>, by way of <i>Prevention</i>: The
<i>Other</i> for those of the <i>tenderer Sort</i> of Constitutions, who
begin to suffer immediately under the common <i>Symptoms</i>:
Upon which Affair I shall give a few necessary
<i>Precautions</i> adapted to <i>Both</i>, with all possible Discretion
and Judgment.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Conceiv’d Woman</i> then is to observe a good,
wholesome, and regular <i>DIET</i>; since <i>Errors</i> committed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>that way, with respect either to <i>Quantity</i> or <i>Quality</i>,
may be of <i>double Damage</i>; I mean, both to the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>
and the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>. She should therefore eat rather <i>Often</i>,
than <i>Much</i> at a <i>Meal</i>; especially at <i>Nights</i>, without fasting
too long at any Time.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> is discreetly to avoid all unwholesome, or
intemperate <i>Air</i>, and not expose herself to any <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Excess</span></em>
of <i>Heat</i> or <i>Cold</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> must not desire rashly to walk much
abroad in <i>Moon-Shine</i>, nor to <i>wash</i> her Head in <i>Sun-Shine</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought not to frequent <i>Gardens</i>; and that
for the following <i>Two-fold Reason</i>: <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>First</span></em>, lest perchance
she happen to sit or tread upon some <i>Herb</i> of a
pernicious <i>Quality</i>; as divers are, in provoking <i>Abortion</i>:
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Secondly</span></em>, lest she covet some <i>Fruit</i> or <i>Herbs</i>, which
may be of Damage or Inconveniency if <i>allow’d</i>, and the
same if <i>deny’d</i> Her.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> is prudently to avoid all <i>Odoriferous</i> or
<i>Perfum</i>’d, as well as <i>Stinking Nauseous</i> <span class='sc'>Smells</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> must carefully shun <i>sitting</i> or <i>lying hard</i>,
and also <i>lifting</i> any heavy <i>Weight</i>, or her <i>Arms</i> above her
<i>Head</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought purposely to forbear all <i>hard Labour</i>,
and <i>violent Emotions</i> of Body.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> is prudently to avoid all Apprehensions
of <i>Fears</i> and <i>Frights</i>, and not to be <i>surpriz’d</i> at any thing
she hears or sees.</p>

<p class='c005'>IX. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> is cautiously to decline <i>Watchings</i>, and
sitting up late at <i>Nights</i>; but must indulge <i>moderate
Sleep</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>X. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> must not <i>lace</i> herself (as <i>before</i>) with
<i>Whalebone-Stays</i>, nor use <i>Busks</i>; which may not only
spoil her <i>Breasts</i> and <i>Belly</i>, but also <i>mis-shape</i> the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>,
if <i>Abortion</i> does not immediately follow.</p>

<p class='c005'>XI. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought discreetly to suppress all <i>Anger</i>,
<i>Passion</i>, and other <i>Perturbations</i> of Mind, and avoid entertaining
too <i>serious</i> or <i>melancholick Thoughts</i>; since all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span><i>such</i> tend to impress a <i>Depravity</i> of Nature upon the
<span class='sc'>Infant’s</span> <i>Mind</i>, and <i>Deformity</i> on its <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>XII. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> is not to be too <i>Busy</i>, or <i>Attentive</i>, fixing
her <i>Eyes</i> too much upon any one <span class='sc'>Object</span>; especially
on deformed <i>ugly Persons</i>, or any such accidental
<i>disagreeable Sight</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>XIII. <em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to her <i>Appetite</i>, she ought to set the <i>Delphick
Oracle</i> before her (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nil nimium cupito</span></i>) and <i>desire</i>
nothing but what <i>she can have</i> to her Satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c005'>XIV. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> must carefully avoid all strong <i>purging
Medicines</i>,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c017'><sup>[56]</sup></a> especially before the <i>fourth</i>, and after the
<i>sixth Month</i>: And even <i>Then</i> also, unless a Necessity of
turgid <i>Matter</i>, or unfix’d <i>Humours</i>, oblige her to it,
or require <i>Evacuation</i>. She is also likewise to abstain
from all <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Phlebotomy</span></em><a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c017'><sup>[57]</sup></a>, especially in the <i>latter
Months</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>XV. <em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to her <i>Exercise</i>, of what kind soever, the
following general <i>Rule</i> may suffice; <i>viz.</i> the <i>first Month</i>
she ought not to <i>exercise</i> herself at all: The <i>second</i>,
but seldom and slowly: The <i>third</i>, oftner and briskly:
The <i>fourth</i>, <i>fifth</i>, and <i>sixth</i>, moderately and boldly:
The <i>seventh</i>, <i>eighth</i>, and to the middle of the <i>ninth</i>,
she should study by degrees to reduce Herself discreetly,
and abstain from all her wonted <i>Exercise</i>, and act
very circumspectly in all Regards; especially<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c017'><sup>[58]</sup></a> the <i>eighth
Month</i>, which is the most dangerous and troublesome
of all the Time of <i>Pregnancy</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>XVI. <em class='gesperrt'>LASTLY</em>, Let her <i>State of Health</i> be never
so good, she ought to take proper <i>Medicines</i> to strengthen
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, as well as the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Fœtus</span></em>, in order to
prevent <i>Accidents</i>, which may happen to the <i>strongest
Woman</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> as to <i>Women</i> of more <i>tender Constitutions</i>, they
are not only subject to the <i>common Symptoms</i>, but often
liable also to <i>acute Diseases</i>; such as <i>Fevers</i>, <i>Pleurisies</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span><i>Squincies</i>, <i>Inflammations</i>, <i>Epilepsies</i>, <i>Apoplexies</i>, <i>Convulsions</i>,
<i>Contractions</i> of the Limbs, Joints, <i>&amp;c.</i> In which
<i>Cases</i>, I may reasonably recommend the <span class='sc'>Patient</span> to the
ablest <i>Physician</i>; since none but the most Judicious
ought to undertake them in such critical Conjunctures.
Because it is no ways <span class='sc'>Safe</span> to use the <i>same Means</i> and
<i>Medicines</i> with the <i>Pregnant Woman</i> (which those incident
<i>Diseases</i> would otherways regularly require;) without
a due <i>Distinction</i> and a nice <i>Regard</i> had to her other
<span class='sc'>Habits</span> of <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>tender Women</i> are also sometimes seiz’d
with <i>Chronical Distempers</i>; such as <i>intermitting Fevers</i>,
<i>lingring Coughs</i>, &amp;c: But, in those <i>Cases</i>, <span class='sc'>Prescriptions</span>
are not so Proper or Convenient, unless the <i>Distemper</i>
be very severe and extremely prejudicial to the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span>,
because they commonly wear off before the <span class='sc'>Delivery</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, be the <i>Constitution</i>, or Condition, of
the <i>Woman</i> as it will, I mean, <i>Strong</i> or <i>Weak</i>, <i>Healthy</i>
or <i>Sickly</i>, all prudent <span class='sc'>Parents</span>, who desire to be bless’d
with comely, tractable, and hopeful <i>Children</i>, ought
not only to perform their <i>Nuptial Duties</i> with great <i>Serenity
of Mind</i>, but also to take mutual <i>Care</i> to prevent
and suppress all <i>Family-Tumults</i> or <i>Domestick Storms</i>: For
there never ought so much as a <i>Cloud</i> to appear in their
<i>Conjugal Society</i>; since all such unhappy <i>Accidents</i> strongly
affect the growing <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, and intail the same <i>Qualities</i>
of <span class='sc'>Disposition</span> almost indelibly imprinted upon it.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> IV.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>SYMPTOMS</em> of the first three Months.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Prolifick Seed</i> being duly coagulated by a
gentle <i>Ebullition</i> of its own <i>vegetative Faculty</i>, by
the Power of the <i>Plastick Virtue</i> of the vital <i>Spirits</i>, and
by the peculiar innate <i>Quality</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Matrix</span></em>; this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>inlivened Substance produceth an <i>Organical Body</i>, of a
perfectly form’d, and delineated <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Foetus</span></em>: Which <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Foetus</span></em>,
according to the various <i>Steps</i> of its Progression in
<i>Formation</i>, <i>Animation</i>, and <i>Maturation</i>, occasions as many
various and different <i>Effects</i> upon the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Bearing
Woman</span></em>; as necessary <i>Consequences</i> of the said three
principal <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Acts</span></em> of the <i>Infant’s</i> Constitution.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> these consequential <i>Effects</i> may be properly divided
into <i>Three</i> <span class='sc'>Classes</span>; which are accordingly call’d
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Symptoms</span></em> of the <i>First</i>, <i>Second</i>, or <i>Middle</i>; and of the
last <i>Three Months</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> it is to be observ’d by the Way, that all <i>Women</i>
are not alike subjected to them; <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Some</span></em> being more
troubled with <i>Those</i> of the <i>First</i>; <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Others</span></em> also with
<i>Those</i> of the <i>Second</i>; and <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Others</span></em> again with the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Symptoms</span></em>
of the <i>last Three Months</i>. But there are <i>some Women</i>,
in fine, that continue to be troubled, in the <i>Middle
Months</i>, with the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Symptoms</span></em> of the <i>First</i>; and in the
<i>Latter</i>, with some of <i>Those</i> of the <i>Second</i>: All which
happens according to their various <i>Regimens</i>, <i>Dispositions</i>
and <i>Habits</i> of Body.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, to proceed methodically, with all
Submission, according to what competent <i>Knowledge</i>
and <i>Experience</i> I have of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Conceiv’d Woman</span></em>; the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Symptoms</span></em> most common to <i>Her</i>, in the <i>First Three
Months</i>, may be briefly reduced to the following principal
<i>Eight</i> in Number; namely, (1.) <i>Vomiting or Nauseating</i>.
(2.) <i>Fastidy</i> or <i>Loathing</i>. (3.) <i>Pica</i> or <i>Longing</i>.
(4.) <i>Painful Cholicks</i> or <i>Gripes</i>. (5.) <i>Diarrhea</i> or <i>Looseness</i>.
(6.) <i>Tooth-Aches</i>. (7.) <i>Head-Aches</i>. And, (8.) <i>Swimmings
of the Head</i>. Of all which, I shall now separately
treat in their Order.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span></div>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> V.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>VOMITING</em>, or <em class='gesperrt'>NAUSEATING</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>VOMITING</em> is a strong and sudden <i>Contraction</i>
of the whole <i>Stomach</i>, occasion’d by the <i>Animal
Spirit’s</i> being preternaturally <i>expanded</i> in its <i>orbicular</i> as
well as <i>oblong Fibres</i>, and the too quick and violent <i>Exertion</i>
of their <i>Elastick Power</i>: Or otherwise, it is a
<i>Convulsive Motion</i> of the <i>Stomach</i>, whereby, when the
<i>Fibres</i>, which compose its middle or <i>muscular Tunick</i>,
are all at once strongly contracted, it endeavours to
eject through the <i>Oesophagus</i> and <i>Mouth</i> the Contents of
its <i>Cavity</i>; to which the <i>Gullet</i> itself (being of a piece
with the <i>Stomach</i>) and the <i>Muscles</i> of the <i>Belly</i> contribute
not a little.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> <i>Definition</i> comprehends the <i>immediate
Cause</i> of all <i>Vomitings</i>; and tho’ there be many external
and internal <i>mediate Causes</i>, yet, I think, in the present
Case of the <i>pregnant Woman</i>, the Cause of this
<span class='sc'>Symptom</span> proceeds chiefly from the <i>Vapours</i> of the exhaled
<span class='sc'>Humours</span>, and the worse Part of the <span class='sc'>Blood</span>;
infesting the <i>Tunicks</i> of the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Ventricle</span>,
and flying into the <i>Cavity</i> of the <span class='sc'>Stomach</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em>, if <i>slightly</i> affected, occasions only a <i>nauseous
Spitting</i>, or <i>gentle Vomiting</i>; but if more <i>severely</i>, it
excites a far worse <i>Vomiting</i>, with a certain grievous
<i>Pain</i> and <i>Torment</i> of the Person afflicted. Now if those
<i>Vapours</i> be of a <i>calid Quality</i>, they commonly occasion
a stinking and burning kind of <i>Belching</i>; but if <i>frigid</i>,
perhaps, on the contrary, a troublesome sour, acid,
<i>breaking of Wind</i>: Both of which promote <i>frequent Vomiting</i>,
that carries off the <i>vicious Juices</i>; so that the
<span class='sc'>Symptom</span> commonly ceases (of itself) in the <i>second</i> or
<i>third Month</i>. Wherefore this ill <i>Habit</i> need not be industriously
restrain’d, unless very <i>Troublesome</i>; as in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>above-mention’d <i>Case</i>, when attended with extreme <i>Severity
of Pain</i>: For <i>then</i> it is not without <i>Danger</i>, and
therefore requires immediate <i>Remedy</i> or <span class='sc'>Cure</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> <i>Cure</i>, I humbly conceive, maybe judiciously
effected by expelling the <i>Cause</i>, and strengthening
the <i>Ventricle</i>; so that it may be capable to repel
those <i>Vapours</i>, or <i>Humours</i>, ascending from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>;
and may either entirely subvert or repress <i>Those</i> previously
receiv’d.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VI.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>FASTIDY</em>, or <em class='gesperrt'>LOATHING</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> of this <span class='sc'>Symptom</span> proceeds from the
worse Sort and more ignoble Part of the <span class='sc'>Blood</span>;
which, in concert with the <i>Humours</i>, perverts the <i>Temperature</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Stomach</span>, by flowing towards its Orifice:
And <i>This</i>, upon emitting <i>Vapours</i> to the <i>same</i>,
strongly impresseth such <i>vicious Qualities</i> upon it, as
doth occasion sometimes a <span class='sc'>Loathing</span> of <i>All Meats</i>, and
sometimes only an <i>Aversion</i> to some certain <i>particular
Dishes of Meat</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> last <i>Case</i> happens most commonly, and
especially at the Time of <i>New</i> and <i>Full-Moon</i>. Now this
<span class='sc'>Loathing</span> may be <i>thus</i> distinguished: To wit; if it
rises from <i>bilous</i> or <i>cholerick Humours</i>, the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> feels
a gnawing or biting of the <i>Ventricle</i>, and is afflicted
with a frequent <i>great Thirst</i>: If from <i>putrid Humours</i>,
she is (at several Times) <i>feverishly inclined</i>: And if
from <i>moderate gross Humours</i>, the only <span class='sc'>Sign</span> is a <i>frequent
Spitting</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> ceases (of itself) in due Progress
of Time: For as the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span> (which as yet is only
<i>sustain’d</i> by the better and nobler Part of the <span class='sc'>Blood</span>)
grows <i>bigger</i>, it requires the <i>larger Quantity</i>, and at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>last the <span class='sc'>Whole</span> of the <i>Menstruous</i> <span class='sc'>Blood</span> for its <i>Sustenance</i>;
at which Time also the accumulated <i>Humours</i>
likewise are lodg’d in their proper Place: <i>Both</i> which
<i>Causes</i> being thus remov’d, the <i>Effect</i> ceases of course
by degrees. However it is prudent, to prevent this
<i>Evil</i>, from the beginning of Conception, by proper
<i>Medicines</i>; but otherways (whenever it happens) unless
the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span> be endanger’d for want of sufficient
Aliment, Time and Patience are the fitted <i>Remedies</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>WOMEN</em> subject to this <span class='sc'>Symptom</span>, are indeed
desirous of <i>Meat</i> and <i>Drink</i>; yet commonly of
<i>such</i>, as is not only <i>disagreeable</i>, but also <i>offensive</i> and
<i>prejudicial</i> to <span class='sc'>Nature</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> violent <i>Excess</i> of this <i>vicious</i> or <i>degenerate Appetite</i>
is wonderful; as frequently appears by many <i>unnatural
Instances</i>, which I shall forbear mentioning in
this Place, for fear of ill Consequences; so that I can
only recommend the <i>Curious</i> to the<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c017'><sup>[59]</sup></a><i>Authorities</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Margin</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> of this <i>SYMPTOM</i> proceeds from the
various <i>Humours</i> of deprav’d <i>Qualities</i>, inherent in the
<i>Tunicks</i> of the <i>STOMACH</i>, vitiating the <i>Ferment</i> of the
<i>VENTRICLE</i>; and so affecting the <i>Orifice</i>, that it becomes
the very <i>Seat</i> and <i>Source</i> of this <i>Evil</i>: from
whence arises the <i>Variety</i> of the <i>Humours</i>, exciting a
strange and uncommon <i>Variety</i> of <span class='sc'>Appetite</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Nature</i> and <i>Quality</i> of these <em class='gesperrt'><i>HUMOURS</i></em>,
have occasion’d many learned <i>Disputes</i>, which yet remain
undecided. But tho’ <i>Platerus</i> takes upon himself
to call them <i>Malignant</i> and <i>Poisonous</i>, yet it is the <i>Opinion</i>
of many <i>learned Men</i>, and as excellent <i>Authors</i>, that
<i>They</i> are not to be justly accounted for, any farther
than that they are of an <i>occult perverse Quality</i>, generated
in the <i>STOMACH</i>, from irregular <i>Diet</i>, improper <i>Food</i>,
and bad <i>Concoction</i>, attended with an <i>erroneous Regimen</i>
in other Cases.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> begins commonly about the 40th
<i>Day</i> from <i>Conception</i>, and continues to the 4th <i>Month</i>:
Against which time, part of the <i>vitious Humours</i> are
excreted or thrown up by <i>Vomiting</i>, and the Remainder
(by degrees) imbib’d by the <i>growing Infant</i>; which
<i>Humours</i> being so consum’d, the <i>Distemper</i> ceases of
Course.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Effect</i> is more extreme and disorderly in
bearing a <span class='sc'>Girl</span> than a <span class='sc'>Boy</span>; the <i>pituitous Humours</i> having
less <i>Concoction</i>, because of the want of requisite
<i>Heat</i>: Which for the same Reason also occasions disagreeable
<i>Flatulencies</i>, <i>Belchings</i>, and <i>Fluctuations</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have, in the Course of my Experience, observ’d
this <i>Evil</i> to be most common in <i>Holland</i>; partly because
of the <i>thick</i> condensed <i>Air</i> of the Country, and partly
because the <i>Commonalty</i> of the <i>Women</i> live but on gross
and cold Food, Fruit, Acids, <i>&amp;c.</i> and are consequently
of a cold humid <i>Temperature</i>, very subject to this Evil.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Diagnostick Signs</i> of this <em class='gesperrt'><i>SYMPTOM</i></em>, are
Weakness of <i>Body</i>, Dissolution of <i>Limbs</i>, Gnawing of
<i>Stomach</i>, Loathing of <i>wholesome Food</i>, (and even <i>That</i>
very often which the <i>Party</i> lov’d before) <i>Anxiety</i>, <i>Pensiveness</i>,
frequent <i>Spittings</i>, and (at several times) <i>Vomitings</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> the <i>Ventricle</i> or <i>Stomach</i> is only slightly affected
with some sort of <i>viscous</i> and <i>frigid Humours</i>, the <i>Party</i>
generally <i>longs</i> for <i>sharp</i> and <i>tart Meats</i>; if with <i>calid</i>
and <i>hot</i> ones, she craves for those which are <i>bitter</i> and
<i>biting</i>: But if more severely affected, with <i>Humours</i> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>some perverse <i>occult Quality</i>, she longs for <i>strange unaccountable
Matters</i>; and hence it is that all <i>monstrous
APPETITES</i> proceed.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> if such <i>Humours</i> become <i>Connatural</i> to the
<i>Woman</i>, by the <i>deep Impression</i> of Diuturnity, she longs
for things <i>resembling</i> the very same <i>Nature</i> of the <i>Humours</i>:
As for Example, if they be of a <i>burning</i> or
<i>parching Nature</i>, she covets to eat <i>COALS</i>, <i>CINDERS</i>,
&amp;c. if of a <i>gross</i> and <i>thick Quality</i>, <i>CHALK</i>, <i>LIME</i>,
&amp;c. if of a <i>Saltish</i> Kind, <i>SALT</i> itself: if of a <i>Melancholick</i>
Temper, <i>EARTH</i>, <i>CLAY</i>, <i>DUST</i>, &amp;c. For because,
as the Thing <i>containing</i> changes the <i>Contents</i>, so
the <i>Contents</i> (in process of time, by Force of <i>constant
Impression</i>) change the Thing <i>containing</i>. In like manner
as <i>deprav’d Wine</i> imparts a vitious <i>Taste</i> or <i>Savour</i>
to the <i>CASK</i>, so those <i>Humours</i> convert the Temperature
of the <i>STOMACH</i> into their own <i>Natural Qualities</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> Similitude and Dissimilitude of <i>Humours</i> and
<i>Temperature</i>, may be thus known and distinguished,
<i>viz.</i> The <span class='sc'>Appetite</span>, longing for things of a <i>like</i> or <i>resembling
Nature</i> (as above), remains still <i>unsatisfy’d</i>, tho’
plentifully indulg’d with the Thing desir’d: Whereas
the <span class='sc'>Appetite</span> of <i>different</i> or<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c017'><sup>[60]</sup></a><i>discording</i> Things, having
obtain’d the Thing <i>long’d</i> for, is easily <i>satiated</i>, and immediately
ceaseth.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Malicious</i> or <i>Lusting <em class='gesperrt'>SYMPTOM</em></i>, is
most <i>dangerous</i>; degenerating commonly into a <i>Cacochymy</i>,
<i>Dropsy</i>, <i>Phthisick</i>, or some other heavy <i>Disease</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> the greatest Hardship or Misfortune, after
All, is <i>This</i>; that, if the <i>Woman</i> doth not indulge her
corrupt <i>APPETITE</i>, she <i>languishes</i> and <i>pines</i> to such a
degree, that her<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c017'><sup>[61]</sup></a>Life is often endanger’d, together
with the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span>, by the Disappointment: and if she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>does so gratify herself, <i>This</i> often proves of the worst of
Consequences, even sometimes to a mortal Fatality.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, in short, this <i>SYMPTOM</i> is like
many <i>Others</i>, more easily <i>prevented</i>, than <i>cur’d</i>: Wherefore
all <i>Women</i>, as soon as they <i>conceive</i>, ought (at repeated
Times) to use proper <i>Anti-kittean Medicines</i> (that
is, against <i>PICA</i> or <i>Longing</i>) and be very careful of
their <i>Regimen</i> and <i>Diet</i>: But when, perhaps, by neglect
of those <i>Means</i>, the <i>Distemper</i> appears inordinate, the
Method of <span class='sc'>Cure</span> consists in evacuating the Humours,
and in absterging, alterating, and corroborating the
<span class='sc'>Stomach</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VIII.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>CHOLICKS</em> and <em class='gesperrt'>GRIPES</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THO’</em> the <i>Cholick</i> derives its Name from the Gut
<i>Colon</i>, I mean by it not precisely that <i>Pain</i> which
affects <i>This</i> only, but that also which usually invades
other <i>Guts</i>, whether thin or thick; because one <i>Gut</i> seems
not to be more subject than another to this Pain; the
<i>Contexture</i> of all of <i>them</i> being the same every where.
So that the <i>Cholick</i> is nothing else than a sorrowful <i>Sensation</i>
of a very sharp <i>Pain</i>, infesting the <i>Guts</i>, or the
Nervous <i>Plexus</i>, or <i>Membranes</i> in their Neighbourhood,
proceeding from wandering <i>Winds</i> and <i>Flatulencies</i> in
the <span class='sc'>Abdomen</span>, or lower Belly; arising from the <i>Humours</i>
aggregated about the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>: which, dissipating
themselves, distend the <i>Intestines</i>, and excite most severe
<i>Pains</i> about the <span class='sc'>Navel</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>Effects</i> may also proceed from indurated
<i>Excrements</i> in the <span class='sc'>Rectum</span>; or from any <i>other Matter</i>,
which either compresses, obstructs, or erodes the <i>Intestines</i>:
Hence <i>Physicians</i> commonly take notice of <i>Three</i>
different Sorts of <i>Cholicks</i>; namely, the <i>Flatulent</i>, the
<i>Bilous</i>, and the <i>Pituitous</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> <i>These</i> are All thus distinguished: The
<i>Wind-Cholick</i> traverses the Belly, and gives an excruciating
wandring <i>Pain</i> in the <span class='sc'>Viscera</span>, or <i>Bowels</i>, &amp;c.
The <i>Bilous</i> induces a certain Pain, with a very sensible
<i>Mordacity</i>; and is generally attended with <i>Thirst</i> and a
<i>Bitterness</i> in the <span class='sc'>Mouth</span>: The <i>Pituitous</i> gives a most
sharp penetrating fixed <i>Pain</i>, resembling (as it were)
a driven <i>Stake</i>, or perforating <i>Instrument</i>; attended with
a <i>Nausea</i>, <i>Vomiting</i>, and <i>Retention</i> of Excrements, <i>&amp;c.</i>
This last Sort <i>Galen</i> calls the most cruel <span class='sc'>Cholick</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> I take it to be the <i>First</i> of these,
which most commonly afflicts the <i>Conceiv’d Woman</i>;
generated of improper <i>Diet</i>, or proceeding from an
irregular <i>Regimen</i>: And <i>This</i> is also sometimes so excessive,
that I’ve seen the <em class='gesperrt'><i>PATIENT</i></em> fall by its Extremity
into a <i>Lipothymia</i>, or <i>Swooning-Fit</i>, which generally
presages <em class='gesperrt'><i>ABORTION</i></em>, if not seasonably prevented
by proper <i>Discutients</i>, and convenient <i>Diet</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>A <i>Looseness</i>, in my Sense, is an immoderate, frequent
and sudden going to <span class='sc'>Stool</span>: in which the <i>liquid</i>
and <i>diluted</i>, as well as <i>sharp</i> and <i>peccant</i>, <i>Excrements</i> are
voided, which is commonly preceded by the <i>Belly-ach</i>
and <i>Gripes</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> differs from a <span class='sc'>Lienteria</span>, in that the <i>Excrements</i>
are not indigested, unaltered, or <i>Chylous</i>, nor the <span class='sc'>Stools</span>
so quick after Meals: As it also differs from the
<i>bloody Hepatick</i>, and <i>Hemorrhoidal Flux</i>, in that no <i>Blood</i>,
<i>Matter</i>, or <i>Liquor</i> like that, in which Meat may have
been wash’d, is voided with the <i>Excrements</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SOME</em> <i>Loosenesses</i> are call’d <i>Bilous</i>, when so much of
the sharp <i>Gall</i> is expell’d as tinges the <i>Excrements Yellow</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>however mix’d with other <i>serous Matter</i>: <i>Others</i> are
call’d <i>serous</i> and <i>pituitous</i>, in which viscous watery
<i>Humours</i>, less impregnated with <span class='sc'>Gall</span>, are frequently
and copiously voided.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> may proceed from a great Variety
of <i>Causes</i>: For an <i>Error</i> committed accidentally in
<i>eating</i> or <i>drinking</i>, or any <i>Irregularity</i> in the way of
Living may occasion it.
<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c017'><sup>[62]</sup></a>
<em class='gesperrt'><i>HIPPOCRATES</i></em> and many <i>others</i>, justly observe
this <i>Case</i> to be dangerous; because it not only relaxes
and debilitates the <i>Body</i> of the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>, and <i>Ligaments</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>; but also necessarily impairs its
requisite <i>Nourishment</i>, and provokes <i>Nature</i> to an <i>untimely
Expulsion</i> of the tender Fruit. Which unhappy
<i>Consequence</i> ought (by all means) to be prevented, if
possible, and the grievous <i>Affection</i> to be cured without
any Loss of Time: Now I presume <i>That</i> may be done
<i>first</i>, by gentle <i>Abstergents</i> and <i>Corroborants</i>; and <i>Then</i> afterwards
by proper <i>Restringents</i> and <i>Strengthners</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> of this <span class='sc'>Symptom</span>, proceeds from the
sharper part of the <i>Humours</i>; which, ascending
to the <i>Head</i>, vitiates the <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, and thence occasions a
<i>effluxion</i> of <i>Rheum</i> upon the <span class='sc'>Teeth</span>: So that <i>This</i> vitious
<i>Rheum</i> fixing itself at some of their <i>Roots</i>, affects the
<i>Membranous Parts</i> so sensibly, that instead of a small
<i>Ach</i>, it proves a great <i>Pain</i>, and almost intolerable

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> ill <i>Affection</i> may also proceed from some

<span class='sc'>Teeth</span>: Where, if it corrupts and lies putrefying, it
commonly engenders <span class='sc'>Worms</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> all which <i>Cases</i>, I humbly conceive, it may be

different Quality of the <span class='sc'>Cause</span>, whether <i>Frigid</i>, <i>Calid</i>,

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>OF</em> all the <i>Parts</i> of the Body, the <span class='sc'>Head</span> is most
expos’d to <i>Pains</i>; that is, to a troublesome and
grievous <i>Sensation</i> of the <i>Membranous Parts</i>; proceeding
from <i>Vapours</i> of the noxious <i>Humours</i>; which ascending
to the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, distend and rend, in a manner, the <i>Membranes</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Brain</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Parts</i> most commonly affected, are the <i>Hairy
Scalp</i>, the <i>Pericranium</i>, and the <i>Diploe</i>; That is, the
medullous <i>Duplicature</i> of the <span class='sc'>Cranium</span>, otherways
call’d the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Meditullium</span></i>: For these <i>Parts</i>, by a continual
<i>Solution</i>, when it happens so, are always most severely
pain’d. But besides, in a <i>Woman</i> that has conceiv’d,
the <i>Pains</i> commonly shift and move from one Place, to
another, of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>; and take certain <i>Intervals</i>,
longer or shorter, betwixt their <i>Access</i> and <i>Recess</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> as the <i>Infant</i> grows, and exhausts a greater
Quantity, or at last the <i>whole</i> of the <span class='sc'>Blood</span>; and as
the <i>Humours</i> fix in their proper Place: So this <span class='sc'>Symptom</span>
gradually goes off, and quite ceases.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, in case the <i>Accesses</i> be long and

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XII.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>MEGRIM</em>, or <em class='gesperrt'>VERTIGO</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> begins with a <i>Swimming</i>, <i>Giddiness</i>,
or <i>Dizziness</i> of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, and proceeds (in the
<i>conceiv’d Woman</i>) from <i>Vapours</i> of the <i>Humours</i>; which,
ascending partly thro’ the <i>Veins</i> and <i>Arteries</i> tending to
the <span class='sc'>Brain</span>, and partly thro’ the <span class='sc'>Oesophagus</span> or <i>Gullet</i>,
disturb the Animal Spirits.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> This <i>Distemper</i> is <i>Two-fold</i>, and distinguished
by the Words <span class='sc'>Vertigo</span> and <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tenebricosa</span></span>; which last
the <i>Arabian Physicians</i> have call’d <i>Scotomia</i>, I suppose
from the <i>Greek</i> Word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σκοτος</span>, <i>Tenebræ</i>, Darkness; and is
now generally receiv’d by that Name.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> because this sad <i>Affection</i> is too common to
both <i>Sexes</i>, young and old, I shall proceed to a farther
Dilucidation of it, for the universal Good and Benefit
of All.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em> then, the<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c017'><sup>[63]</sup></a><i>VERTIGO</i> is a deprav’d <i>Imagination</i>,
attended with the vitiated <span class='sc'>Senses</span> of <i>Hearing</i>
and <i>Seeing</i>; proceeding from the violent Commotion of
the <i>Animal Spirits</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, The <i>SCOTOMIA</i> is also a
deprav’d <i>Imagination</i>, accompany’d with loss of <i>Sight</i>,
and sometimes of the <i>Motion</i> of the <i>Animals</i> affected
with it, because of some <i>Interruption</i> in their circular
Passage. In the <i>first Case</i>, the <i>PATIENT</i> imagines his
Head only to be turn’d round, or winded about: In
the <i>other</i>, he thinks that <i>circular Motion</i> to consist in
the <i>external Objects</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> the <i>VERTIGO</i> is attended with the vitiated
<span class='sc'>Sense</span> of <i>Hearing</i>, as well as <i>Seeing</i>: Because, as
something like a <i>Cloud</i>, <i>Smoak</i>, or <i>Web</i>, seems to appear
before the <span class='sc'>Patient</span>’s <i>Eyes</i>; so there is a certain <i>Whistling</i>,
<i>Hissing</i>, or Tinkling always in his <i>Ears</i>. The
<span class='sc'>Scotomia</span>, in like manner, is attended with Loss of
<i>Sight</i>, and <i>Motion</i>; because of some <i>Disorder</i> of the <i>Ventricles</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Brain</span> obstructing or impeding the <i>Transition</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Spirits</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <span class='sc'>Vertigo</span>, an <i>Agitation</i> happens in the <i>Membranes</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Veins</span> and <span class='sc'>Arteries</span>, as also in the <i>Membranes</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Brain</span>; by which violent <i>Motion</i>, the
very <i>Continent Parts</i> are vehemently shaken and concuss’d,
and at length so disquieted, that the <span class='sc'>Patient</span>
thinks his <span class='sc'>Head</span> wheels round about.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <span class='sc'>Scotomia</span>, the <i>Animal Spirits</i> having in
themselves the <i>Species</i> of all Sensibles, and those <i>Species</i>
being presented to the <i>Imagination</i>: As such <i>Images</i> of
external <i>Objects</i> are moved in it, so the <i>Party</i> thinks the
same <i>real Objects</i> to be moved. For, according to <i>Avicen</i>,
it is the same thing, whether that which is <i>seen</i>,
or that by which we <i>see</i>, is moved: As seeing <i>Land</i>
from on board a <i>Ship</i>, in a smooth Sea, being insensible
of the <i>Ship’s Way</i>, we imagine (and sometimes
very strongly too) that the <span class='sc'>Land</span> is in <i>Motion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> by which we <i>see</i>, is the <i>visible Species</i> reserved
in the <i>Spirit</i>: Hence when this <i>Species</i> is moved,
the <i>external Object</i> seems also to be <i>moved</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in explaining the <i>Circular Motion</i> of the <i>Animal
Spirits</i>, we must consider it to be <i>twofold</i>; namely,
<i>Natural</i> and <i>Preternatural</i>: The <i>Natural Motion</i> is that
which begins in the <i>Carotide Arteries</i>, thence tending to
the <i>Plexus Choroideus</i>, or the <i>anteriour Ventricles</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Brain</span>; from <i>These</i> to the <i>middle</i>; from the <i>middle</i> to
the <i>Posteriours</i>; and from the <i>posteriour Ventricles</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Brain</span>, the <i>Spirits</i> are imparted to the <span class='sc'>Nerves</span>. The
<i>Preternatural Motion</i> is just the <i>Reverse</i> of this Case.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Causes</i> of both these Cases and Conditions
are either <i>immediate</i> or <i>mediate</i>. The <i>immediate Causes</i>
may be reduced to <i>Three Classes</i>; to wit, <i>Causes</i> of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span><i>inordinate Motion</i> of the Animal Spirits, <i>Causes</i> of the
<i>Circular Motions</i>, and <i>Causes</i> of lost <i>Sense</i>, <i>Sight</i>, and
<i>Motion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Causes</i> of the <i>Spirits</i><a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c017'><sup>[64]</sup></a> moving inordinately,
are either <i>External</i> or <i>Internal</i>. The <i>Externals</i> are the
<i>Sun</i>, <i>Hot Baths</i>, <i>Frictions</i>, and <i>Concussions of the</i> <span class='sc'>Head</span>;
or a <i>Fall</i>, <i>Blow</i>, <i>Contusion</i>, and all inordinate and immoderate
<i>Motions</i> of the whole Body: such as <i>Running</i>,
<i>Leaping</i>, <i>Riding</i>, <i>Dancing</i>, too much <i>Venery</i>, or hard
<i>Drinking</i>; as also the Use of <i>Acids</i>, or acrimonious
Things, and all Things replenishing or stuffing the
<span class='sc'>Head</span>; such as <i>Garlick</i>, <i>Mustard</i>, <i>Anise</i>, <i>Parsley</i>, <i>Leeks</i>,
<i>Onions</i>, <i>Radish</i>, strong <i>Snuffs</i>, <i>Drinks</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>internal immediate Causes</i> are the <i>Imagination</i>
of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span>, <i>Vapours</i> of the whole Body, frigid
<i>Flatulencies</i>, and<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c017'><sup>[65]</sup></a>a sudden <i>Fluxion</i> of the <i>vital Spirits</i>
into the <span class='sc'>Head</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>mediate Causes</i> are <i>Material</i>; and this <i>Matter</i><a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c017'><sup>[66]</sup></a>
(almost all <i>Physicians</i> agree) is <i>frigid</i>. From hence it is
certain, that the <i>Distemper</i> proceeds from <i>Crudities</i>, and
<i>Victuals</i> of a crude Juice; such as <i>Pulses</i>, <i>Cheese</i>, <i>Tarts</i>,
<i>Fish</i>, and all <i>other Sorts</i> of the like frigid and humid
<i>Qualities</i>: But <i>these</i> are only to be reckon’d <i>concurring</i>,
not <i>efficient Causes</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> most common <i>material Cause</i> is, according to
<i>Galen</i><a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c017'><sup>[67]</sup></a>, the <span class='sc'>Bile</span>; which, seeking for Vent at the
<i>Mouth of the Stomach</i>, is the <i>Cause</i> of these <i>Symptoms</i>,
and is<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c017'><sup>[68]</sup></a>properly to be educed or evacuated by a due
<i>Vomit</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in Case of <span class='sc'>Vapours</span>, <i>Heat</i> is always the <i>efficient
Cause</i>, elevating them from the peccant <i>Matter</i>;
since a <i>Cold</i>, or a refrigerated <i>Body</i>, can never engender
<span class='sc'>Vapours</span> or <i>Wind</i> from any Material Cause.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>I shall not now enter upon the particular <i>Diagnosticks</i>
of this <i>Distemper</i>, because they are as <i>Various</i>, as
the <i>Causes</i>, and affected <i>Places</i> are different. Let me observe
only, that the <i>simple</i> <span class='sc'>Vertigo</span> is easily known by
the <i>Imagination</i> of the <i>Circular Motion</i> of the <i>Patient’s</i>
<span class='sc'>Head</span>, or That of <i>external Objects</i>, or by vitiated <i>Seeing</i>
and <i>Hearing</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> the <span class='sc'>Scotomia</span> differs from the <span class='sc'>Vertigo</span>, in
that besides the <i>Imagination</i> of the <i>circular Motion</i>, the
<span class='sc'>Patient</span> often loses his <i>Sight</i>, staggers, tumbles, or falls
to the Ground. And yet the <i>same</i> is distinguished
from the <i>Epilepsy</i>, in that the <span class='sc'>Patient</span> retains his principal
<i>Functions</i>, and neither <i>Foams</i> at Mouth, nor is
<i>Convulsive</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, as to the <i>Distinction</i> of Causes, if
the <i>internal Cause</i> proceeds from <i>Calidity</i>, it is known by
the <i>hot Temperament</i> of the whole Body, as well as by
a <i>Swelling</i> and <i>Pulsation</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Arteries</em></span> about the
<i>Throat</i>: Besides that this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Vertigo</em></span> easily <i>accedes</i> and
<i>recedes</i>, it is always attended with <i>Calidity</i> and <i>Redness</i>
of Face and Eyes; with <i>Watchings</i>, <i>Deliriums</i>, &amp;c:
And it commonly follows <i>Fevers</i>, <i>Watchings</i>, <i>Anger</i>, the
<i>Use of Calids</i>, hot Things, <i>&amp;c.</i> In which <i>Cases</i>, it is
always to be helped by the <i>Use of Frigids</i>, or Coolers.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> it arises from <i>frigid Flatulencies</i>, the <i>Paroxysms</i> or
Fits are preceded by a <i>Hissing</i> or <i>Tingling</i> in the <span class='sc'>Ears</span>;
the <span class='sc'>Patient</span> turns <i>pale</i> and <i>wan</i>, and is taken with an
odd extensive <i>Pain</i> of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>: And if these <i>Flatulencies</i>
generate in the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, the <i>Party</i> feels it <i>ponderous</i>,
<i>lumpish</i>, and <i>heavy</i>; and is consequently much inclin’d
to <i>Sleep</i>, <i>Stupidity</i>, <i>Dullness</i>, and <i>Inactivity</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> the <i>Distemper</i> is derived from a <i>flatulent Stomach</i>,
the <i>PATIENT</i> is troubled with <i>Rifting</i> and <i>Rumbling</i>
of the Belly; with <i>Sobbing</i> and <i>Sighing</i>, with <i>Hickups</i>,
<i>Yawnings</i>, <i>Extensions</i>, <i>Inflations</i>, and frequent <i>Spittings</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> it comes from a <i>Mordacity</i> of the <i>Mouth of the Stomach</i>,
the <i>Party</i> is infested with a <i>Nausea</i>, <i>Loathing</i> and
<i>Fastidy</i>; with a Dejection of <i>Appetite</i>, a lasting or frequent
<i>Thirst</i>, and a <i>Bitterness</i> of the Mouth. But this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span><i>Affection</i> also very often proceeds from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and
that either because of the suppress’d <i>Menstrua</i>, or longretain’d
<i>Seed</i>; as will hereafter more fully appear in
<i>Sect.</i> ix. <i>Chap. 8</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the <i>Prognosticks</i> of this <i>Distemper</i>, it does not
always seem <i>Dangerous</i>, much less <i>Lethal</i>, at first; but
its <i>Consequences</i> are (however) very <i>Fatal</i><a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c017'><sup>[69]</sup></a>, if not timely
prevented: For it often turns to <i>Inflammations</i><a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c017'><sup>[70]</sup></a> of the
<span class='sc'>Head</span>, or <i>Convulsions</i>; sometimes to <i>Melancholy</i> or <i>Madness</i>;
and sometimes to <i>Epilepsies</i> or <i>Apoplexies</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> because this <i>Affection</i> observes <i>Lunar Periods</i>,
and in extreme Cases, is near a-kin to the <i>Falling-Sickness</i>;<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c017'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
<i>Cœlius Aurelianus</i> informs us, That it was call’d
by the <i>Ancients</i> the <i>little Epilepsy</i>: And as it admits of
<i>periodical Accessions</i> and <i>Circulations</i> (I mean coming and
going <i>Fits</i>) which depend chiefly upon the Power and
Influence of the <i>New</i> and <i>Full-Moon</i>; so it is to be
treated with respect to <i>Cure</i>, in a different manner;
one way in the <i>Access</i>, another in the <i>Interval</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> this <i>Cure</i> is as different, as the Causes and
Degrees of the <i>Distemper</i> are various; wherefore I can,
by no means, enter upon it in this place, for Brevity-sake.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Foetus</span> having receiv’d a distinct <span class='sc'>Form</span>, constituted
of various <i>Organical Members</i>, and produced

the different <i>Members</i> possessing different <i>Places</i>,
according to the <i>Institution of <em class='gesperrt'>NATURE</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span><em class='gesperrt'>AFTER</em> an absolute and compleat <i>Conformation</i> of
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Organs</em></span>, the rational <i>Soul</i> is infus’d and adapted;
which is the ultimate Perfection of the <i>Human</i> <span class='sc'>Foetus</span>:
By which it becomes <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Man</em></span> and receives <i>Life</i>, living
and subsisting henceforward by its own vivacious <i>Faculties</i>,
distinct from those of the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>. Now the
Great and All-wise <span class='sc'>Creator</span> undoubtedly is the only

this noble <i>Work</i>; which, according to the nicest <i>Calculation</i>
of the greatest <i>Masters</i> of <i>Nature</i>, is most commonly
accomplished about the <i>Beginning</i> of these <i>Middle
Months</i>: At which time, the usual <i>Turn of Nature</i> necessarily
occasions different <i>Effects</i> to the <i>Child-bearing
Woman</i>; which are call’d <i>SYMPTOMS</i> of the <i>Middle
Months</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> these <i>SYMPTOMS</i>, in short, I reduce to the
following <i>Seven</i> in Number; <i>viz.</i> 1. <i>Coughs</i>; 2. <i>Palpitations</i>
or <i>Heart-Beatings</i>; 3. <i>Swoonings</i> or <i>Syncopes</i>; 4.
<i>Watchings</i>; 5. <i>Pains</i> in the <i>Hips</i> and <i>Loins</i>; 6. <i>Hemorrhages</i>

in their due Order.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XIV.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>COUGHS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>COUGHS</em> are either <i>Humid</i> or <i>Siccid</i>: They are
call’d <i>Humid</i>, when the <i>Humours</i> contain’d in the
<i>Aspera Arteria</i>, of whatsoever Nature, are expell’d by
its own Force thro’ the <i>Mouth</i>. And <i>Siccid</i>, or dry
<span class='sc'>Coughs</span>, when, notwithstanding great Pains and
Trouble, nothing is <i>excreted</i>, only the whole Body fatigued
by a continual irritated Endeavour to <i>Cough</i> and
<i>spit-out</i>; whence arise Pains of the <i>Head</i>, <i>Hypochondriacks</i>,
and other Parts.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> of which <i>SYMPTOM</i> is <i>Four-fold</i>, and
proceeds either from the sharp acid <i>Vapours</i> of the
<i>Humours</i> flying towards the <i>Lungs</i>, <i>Wind-pipe</i>, and
<i>Jaws</i>; irritating the natural Faculty to <i>Expulsion</i>: Or,
from the finer Part of the <i>Blood</i>, converting itself to
the <i>pectoral Veins</i>: Or, from the <i>Humours</i> themselves
ascending to the <i>Head</i>, and relapsing upon the <i>Breast</i>:
Or, in fine, from the suppressed <i>Albedines</i> or <span class='sc'>Whites</span>,
and whatsoever may vellicate the <i>Aspera Arteria</i>, or in
any respect oppress or irritate the <i>same</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> (however slighted or lightly esteem’d)
is very Dangerous; forasmuch as it attenuates
and weakens the <i>whole Body</i>, enervates or destroys its
<i>Strength</i> and <i>Vigour</i>, causes difficult <i>Respiration</i>, excites
<i>Head-Aches</i>, hinders <i>natural Rest</i>, occasions <i>Watchings</i>,
promotes Defluxions, and finally gives <i>Origin</i> to <i>Fevers</i>,
as well as most other <i>Diseases</i>: Besides that, it continually
exagitates and distresses the <i>Muscles</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Abdomen</em></span>,
or lower Belly; and thereby too commonly
provokes <i>Miscarriage</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> these Reasons this <i>SYMPTOM</i> ought to be
carefully <i>mitigated</i>, if not <i>cur’d</i>, without any loss of
Time: But the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Cure</em></span> itself, in my humble Opinion,
may be easily effected, by evacuating the <i>peccant Humours</i>,
by purging and corroborating the <i>Head</i>, and by
the right <i>Use</i> of proper <i>Thoracick Medicines</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> Beatings or <i>Palpitations</i> are nothing else
but a sudden Loss of all the Strength, with an
immoderate <i>Concussion</i>, by a vehement <i>Diastole</i>, and molestous
<i>Systole</i> of the <i>HEART</i>: From hence this <i>SYMPTOM</i>
easily turns to a <i>Cardialgia</i>, <i>Lipothymia</i>, or <i>Syncope</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>which are <i>All</i> of near <i>Affinity</i>, in the Case of the <i>Pregnant
Woman</i>, so that I shall treat of them <i>conjunctly</i>,
and first observe; that</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> of all such <i>SYMPTOMS</i> are but <i>Two-fold</i>,
and proceed either from a <i>flatulent</i> Substance of
the <i>Humours</i>, ascending, thro’ the <i>Arteries</i>, or the <i>Vena
Cava</i>, to the <i>HEART</i>: Or from the <i>Abundance</i> of <span class='sc'>Blood</span>,
which (not finding passage by the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>) seeks to the
<i>superiour Parts</i>, and thence oppresses the <i>HEART</i> and
<i>vital Faculty</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Last</i> is the most dangerous <i>Condition</i>, being (in
such <i>Plethorick Women</i>) the certain <i>Prognostick</i> of imminent
<em class='gesperrt'><i>ABORTION</i></em>: To prevent which unhappy <i>Accident</i>,
the principal Part of the <span class='sc'>Cure</span>, depends very much
on cautious <i>Venæ-Sections</i>, or letting Blood, proper
<i>Diet</i>, &amp;c: Whereas, in the <i>First Case</i>, proper <i>Discutients</i>,
<i>Cordials</i>, and <i>Corroborants</i>, are the most convenient
and successful.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> is nothing else, more than an immoderate
<i>Exercitation</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Senses</em></span>, from too
great a <i>Motion</i> of the <i>Animal Spirits</i>: Proceeding from
some acrimonious and siccid <i>Vapours</i> of the <i>Humours</i>,
ascending to the <span class='sc'>Brain</span>, and there disturbing the <i>Spirits</i>,
by exciting their vehement Motion; which so exagitates
the <span class='sc'>Senses</span>, that the vigilant restless <i>Woman</i> gets
either none at all, or but very <i>short Sleep</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> watchful <i>Affection</i> is distinguished by a <i>siccid</i>,
or <i>calid</i> and <i>siccid Intemperature</i>; attended sometimes
with a <i>Melancholick</i>, <i>Bilous</i>, or <i>Pituitous</i>, <i>Saltish</i> Matter;
which is either essentially lodg’d in the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, or communicated
to it from the <i>Mouth of the Stomach</i>, or the
Veins of the whole Body.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span><em class='gesperrt'>SOME</em> have been so overtaken with this <i>SYMPTOM</i>,
that they have not only continued <i>Awake</i> for some
Days and Nights, but also Weeks and Months: Insomuch
that <i>Hercules Saxon</i><a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c017'><sup>[72]</sup></a> relates of his own <i>Father</i>,
that He, being melancholick, suffer’d such like <span class='sc'>Watchings</span>,
without the least <span class='sc'>Sleep</span>, <i>seven Months long</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> in the <i>Child-bearing Woman</i>, the least

insomuch that it often occasions <i>Deliriums</i>,
and <i>Convulsions</i>, by the continual Stretch and <i>Tension</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Fibres</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> the <span class='sc'>Cure</span> of this <i>SYMPTOM</i> may
(I hope) be well perform’d both by <i>external</i> and <i>internal

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XVII.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>PAINS</em> in the Hips, Loins</i>, &amp;c.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>ALTHOUGH</em> these <i>PAINS</i> (in general Terms)
are the <i>Effects</i> of the <i>Compression</i> of the extended
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, hanging on, and bearing too much upon the
neighbouring <i>Parts</i>, by its Gravity and Weight: Yet
the particular <i>Cause</i> of such <i>SYMPTOMS</i> (in my Opinion)
is <i>Two-fold</i>; and proceeds either from the Abundance
of <span class='sc'>Blood</span> lodging in the <i>Veins</i> of those Parts;
or from the growing <span class='sc'>Foetus</span>, so extending the <i>Ligaments</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, as to oblige the neighbouring Parts
to sympathize. From hence the <i>broad Ligaments</i> cause
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAINS</em></i> of the <i>Back</i> and <i>Loins</i>, answering to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span><i>Reins</i>, to which <i>Parts</i> they are strongly fixed; as the
<i>round Ones</i> affect the <i>Groins</i>, <i>Hips</i>, and <i>Thighs</i>, where
they terminate. Which <i>Ligaments</i> are sometimes so violently
extended, especially in the first Time of <i>Pregnancy</i>,
that (by the Concurrence of any slight <i>procatarctick
Cause</i>) they have been often known to break.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cure</i> of these <i>SYMPTOMS</i>, in the <i>first Case</i>
above-mentioned, depends chiefly upon cautious <i>Phlebotomy</i>,
and good <i>Repose</i> in Bed; and in the <i>Second</i>, upon
proper <i>Swathes</i>, <i>Unguents</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>Symptoms</i> are to be understood to happen
only from the superiour Parts; as <i>Nostrils</i>, <i>Mouth</i>,
or <i>Ears</i>: And the <i>Cause</i> seems to be <i>Three-fold</i>: proceeding
either from a more than ordinary <i>Plenty</i> of
<span class='sc'>Blood</span>; or from a gross Mixture of <i>Humours</i> and <span class='sc'>Blood</span>,
prompting Nature to <i>Excretion</i>; or, lastly, from a <i>Debility</i>
and <i>Weakness</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, when not able to attract
the due Quantity of <span class='sc'>Blood</span> to its <i>Subsistence</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>first Case</i>, the <i>Woman</i> usually looks <i>sanguine</i>
and well-colour’d, and hath more <i>Plethorick Marks</i> upon
her; which, if it happens, without any great <i>Inconvenience</i>,
as it is without <i>Danger</i>, the <i>Woman</i> may easily
bear and dispense with it.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>second Case</i>, the <span class='sc'>Blood</span> so lost falls dropping
away, and with <i>Pain</i>; it is ugly and <i>ill-colour’d</i>, of an
<i>acid Quality</i>, and <i>stinking Smell</i>: And the <span class='sc'>Patient</span> hath
more <i>Cacochymic Signs</i> upon her, whereby she is threatned
with <i>Abortion</i> and imminent Danger.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>third Case</i>, the <span class='sc'>Signs</span> of a <i>Debilitated Fœtus</i>,
and instant <i>Abortion</i>, are evidently presented; as mention’d
in Chap. 29, and 30, of this <i>Section</i>: When, if
she chance to escape <i>Miscarriage</i>, (which most commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>happens in this <i>Condition</i>, if not timely and artfully
prevented) a difficult and laborious <span class='sc'>Birth</span> is the certain
<i>Consequence</i>; and sometimes a protracted Time of
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Bearing</span></em> to the <i>Close</i> of the 10th, or (as I have observ’d)
to the <i>Beginning</i> of the 11th <i>Month</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> is to be judg’d of, and <i>cur’d</i> according

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> is to be understood to happen from
the <i>inferiour Parts</i>; namely, by way of the <i>Hæmorrhoidal

most commonly by the <i>Last</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> then of this <i>SYMPTOM</i>, happening by
the <i>Hæmorrhoids</i>, is <i>Three-fold</i>; and proceeds, either
from too great a <i>Quantity</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Blood</span></em> abounding; or
from the disorder’d and deprav’d <i>Quality</i> of that <span class='sc'>Blood</span>;
or from <i>Both</i> these <i>Indispositions</i> jointly: And this sanguine
<i>Affection</i> is commonly without any great Danger
(tho’ not without some Trouble) to the <i>Woman</i>;
ceasing gradually (of itself) after a safe and successful
<em class='gesperrt'><i>DELIVERY</i></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, happens <i>Four</i> different

to the <i>Neck</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; or by <i>Those</i>, which tend to
the <i>Body</i> and <i>Cavity</i> of the <span class='sc'>Same</span>; or by <i>Those</i>, that adhere
to the <i>Membrane</i> call’d <span class='sc'>Chorion</span>, and to the <i>Infant</i>,
by which it attracts its <i>Nutriment</i>; or by <i>Those</i>, that
<i>Nature</i> hath reserv’d for a <i>Superfœtation</i>, or the <i>Necessity</i>
of expurging this <span class='sc'>Blood</span> when it chances to be Superfluous.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHATEVER</em> way this <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Flux</span></em> happens, its <i>Cause</i>
is <i>Three-fold</i>; and proceeds, either from an <i>Apertion</i> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>some of the mentioned <i>Uterine Vessels</i>; or from their
<i>Dilatation</i>; or from a <i>Rupture</i> of those Vessels.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THEY</em> are <i>open’d</i> by a <i>Redundancy</i> or <i>Superfluity</i> of
<span class='sc'>Blood</span>; which <i>Wise Nature</i> takes this <i>Method</i> of fiercing
and throwing-off, the <i>Natural Evacuation</i> being
stopped. They are <i>dilated</i> by the <i>Acrimony</i> of the <i>Humours</i>,
or by their own rarefy’d and thin <i>Contexture</i>,
And, in fine, they may be <i>bursten</i> or <i>broken</i>, by a great
Variety of <i>Accidents</i>; such as <i>Running</i>, <i>Leaping</i>, <i>Falling</i>,
<i>Striking</i>, <i>Lifting</i> a heavy Weight, violent <i>Motion</i>, <i>Coughs</i>,
great <i>Pains</i>, <i>Vapours</i>, <i>Costiveness</i>, <i>Looseness</i>, immoderate
<i>Heat</i>, or <i>Cold</i>; as also by any violent <i>Perturbation</i> of
Mind.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>First Case</i> (being the Work of <i>Nature</i>) happens
with great Ease, and without any Pain or Trouble;
it <i>flows</i> moderately and regularly, is of <i>short Continuance</i>,
and not attended with any immediate <i>Danger</i>, so long
as the <i>Woman</i> enjoys her <i>Health</i>, and continues well-colour’d
in <i>Complexion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Second Case</i> is called an <span class='sc'>Anastomosis</span>; and
what happens by such irregular <i>Dilatations</i>, falls <i>Drop</i>
by <i>Drop</i> away; and is All <i>Acid</i>, <i>Ill-colour’d</i>, <i>Stinking</i>, <i>Thin</i>,
<i>Pale</i>, <i>Serous Stuff</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Third Case</i> is known by an immoderate and
irregular <i>Flooding</i>, as it were in <i>Heaps</i>; attended with
<span class='sc'>Pains</span> of the <i>Groins</i>, <i>Loins</i>, &amp;c: And at last aggravated
with <i>Faintings</i> and <i>Convulsions</i>. The true <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>State</span></em> of
which <i>Case</i> is particularly noted in Sect. V. Chap. 7.
Only give me leave to add here, that the <i>Procatarctick
Cause</i>, is always sufficiently known, from the <i>Relation</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Patient</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> however, it is also proper to know in all
the above-mention’d <i>Cases</i>, from what <i>Place</i>, and by
what <i>Vessels</i> this <i>Flux</i> happens: Which may be rightly
thus distinguished; for if from the <i>Neck</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
it flows orderly and moderately; as it likewise does,
if it comes from <i>Vessels</i> no ways adhering to the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>:
but if it arises from the <i>Bottom</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
it flows in less <i>Order</i>, and greater <i>Quantity</i>; and if it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>happens, in fine, from the <i>Vessels</i> fixed to the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Infant</span></em>,
and the <span class='sc'>Chorion</span>, then it does <i>flow</i> most irregularly of
all, and in very great <i>Quantities</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Prognosticks</i> of this <i>SYMPTOM</i> are, either a<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c017'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
weak debilitated <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, or an approaching <i>Abortion</i>:
But besides also, it sometimes portends a <i>hard</i>, <i>laborious</i>,
and <i>protracted <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>, perhaps even to the 11th
<i>Month</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> <i>Prognosticks</i> are indeed founded upon sufficient
relative <i>Reasons</i>: The <i>First</i>, because the <i>INFANT</i>
is not able to convert the <i>whole</i> of the <i>superabundant</i>
<span class='sc'>Blood</span>, to its <i>Aliment</i>: The <i>Second</i>, because the <i>INFANT</i>
(tho’ perhaps Strong and Able enough) is depriv’d of
its requisite <i>Sustenance</i>: The <i>Third</i>, because (according
to <i>Hippocrates</i>, &amp;c.) a <i>sickly Gestation</i> always indicates a
difficult and laborious <i>BIRTH</i>: And besides the reason
of a <i>protracted Birth</i> (beyond the <i>ordinary Time</i>) is very
plain and perspicuous; because, if a <i>strong healthy CHILD</i>
requires <i>two Months</i>, to recover itself after the first
<i>Onset</i> or <i>Attempt</i> of the <i>7th Month</i>, (as is more amply
explain’d in <i>Chap.</i> 34. of this Section) it is but highly reasonable
to think, that a <i>weak sickly One</i>, requires a <i>longer
Time</i> of Gestation.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>first Case</i> of this <i>SYMPTOM</i>, seems to be the
most favourable of the <i>Three</i>; yet I would advise such
<i>Sanguine</i> or <i>Plethorick Women</i>, to guard against <i>one ill
Consequence</i>, which I have known sometimes to happen
in the same burthensome <i>Condition</i>: Namely, that from
too great a <i>Plenty</i> or <i>Superfluity</i> of <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, it sometimes
runs through the <i>interiour Veins</i> into the <i>Cavity</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, which renders the <i>Case</i> by far the most dangerous;
because this <span class='sc'>Blood</span><a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c017'><sup>[75]</sup></a> (being out of its proper
<i>Canal</i> or <i>Center</i>) irregularly extravas’d, immediately
<i>corrupts</i> and <i>suppurates</i>; which corrupted <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, in Concert
with the <i>INFANT</i>, (whose <i>Aliment</i> is thereby impair’d)
always obliges the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, to dilate and yield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>up its <i>Contents</i>: So that, in short, this particular <i>SYMPTOM</i><a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c017'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
is, in all its different Cases or Conditions, the
most Pernicious and Dangerous.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> it is, that the respective <span class='sc'>Cures</span>
of these sundry <i>Cases</i>, belong only to the Ablest <i>Physician</i>,
and <i>That</i> (most properly) to <i>Him</i> who professes
and practices <span class='sc'>Midwifery</span>: Because, when <i>Medicinal
Helps</i> fail, and cannot prevent <i>Misfortunes</i>, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>He</span></em> will at
least know best then, how to <i>Compose</i>, and <i>Mitigate</i> them,
by delivering the Woman, if Necessity so require.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XX.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>SYMPTOMS</em> of the last three Months</i>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>TWO</em> <i>third Parts</i> of the common Duration and
Conjuncture of <span class='sc'>Child-bearing</span>, being, by this
time faithfully, if not so fully, accounted for; it remains
now, that we also more particularly consider the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>
and her <span class='sc'>Infant</span> throughout the last <i>Three Months-Travail</i>.
These are the <i>Finishing Maturating Months</i> of
the <i>INFANT</i>: I mean peculiarly, as to its <i>Strength</i> and
<i>Vigour</i>; since in other respects, the <i>Middle Months</i> have
duly <i>perfected</i> the Ornaments of the <i>particular Members</i>,
and gracefully compleated the <span class='sc'>Shape</span> and <span class='sc'>Form</span> of the
whole Body.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em>, as, in these <i>latter Months</i>, the
<i>CHILD</i> encreases in <i>Bulk</i>, <i>Vigour</i>, and <i>Activity</i>, it then
affords the tender <span class='sc'>Mother</span> incredible <i>Uneasinesses</i>, and
grows sometimes almost <i>Obstreperous</i>: Which <i>Augmentation</i>
of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Foetus</span></em> (of natural Consequence) occasions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>in her Constitution of Body various different <i>Effects</i>;
call’d <i>SYMPTOMS</i> of the last <i>Three Months</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> these <i>SYMPTOMS</i>, I hope I may pertinently
reduce to the following <i>Nine</i>, in Number; namely,
1. <i>Dysuries</i>; 2. <i>Ischuries</i>; 3. <i>Stranguries</i>; 4. <i>Costiveness</i>;
5. <i>Tenesms</i>; 6. <i>Varices</i>; 7. <i>Inflations</i> of the <i>Legs</i>;
8. <i>Fissures</i> of the Belly; and 9. and lastly, <i>Water-Fluxes</i>.
Of which I shall take leave to treat separately, in their
proper Order.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXI.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>DYSURIES</em>, <em class='gesperrt'>ISCHURIES</em>, and <em class='gesperrt'>STRANGURIES</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Dysuria</i> is a painful and difficult <i>Excretion</i> of
<i>Urine</i>; as the <i>Ischuria</i> is an entire <i>Suppression</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Same</span>: And the <i>Stranguria</i> nothing but an <i>Effect</i>
of the other <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Two</span></em>; being an <i>Excretion</i> made Drop by
Drop, with a continual <i>Stimulation</i> or <i>Propensity</i> to make
Water, however without any acute <i>Pain</i>, tho’ not
without some <i>Uneasiness</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> these <i>three <em class='gesperrt'>SYMPTOMS</em></i> have all their respective
<i>Causes</i>, which I shall not particularly enter upon
here at large; but only, take notice by the By, that
in the <i>Pregnant Woman</i>, they most commonly proceed
from <i>One</i> and the same <i>Original</i>: Wherefore I shall in
this Place discourse of them <i>conjunctly</i>; and observe that
all three <i>SYMPTOMS</i> may proceed from the <i>ponderous</i>
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, lying upon, and depressing the <i>Neck of the Bladder</i>;
and <i>that</i> the more heavily, the nearer the <i>Woman</i>
is to her <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Time</span></em>. The <i>pungent Acrimony</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Urine</span></em>
sometimes also occasions <i>Incontinence</i>, or want of <i>Retention</i>;
as its <i>Inflammatory Heat</i> causeth almost a total <i>Suppression</i>.
However, in short, such <em class='gesperrt'><i>SYMPTOMS</i></em> may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>likewise proceed from some <i>crude</i> and <i>unconcocted Matter</i>,
obstructing and oppressing the <i>Sphincter-Muscles</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BE</em> <i>That</i> as it will, in the present <i>Case</i>, the <span class='sc'>Cure</span> is
but very seldom of great <i>Difficulty</i>; being frequently
effected, by lifting up the <i>Bottom of her Belly</i> with both
Hands when she is about to <i>make Water</i>: Or, by wearing
a convenient large <span class='sc'>Swathe</span>. But if Need require,
the <i>Region</i> of the <span class='sc'>Bladder</span> may be cherished with proper
<i>emollient Fomentations</i>, <i>Injections</i>, or <i>Cataplasms</i>; as
(upon any <i>Extremity</i> at last) a <span class='sc'>Catheter</span> may be prudently
used.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> the <i>SYMPTOM</i> however proceeds from any <i>Inflammatory</i>,
or <i>Acrimonious Quality</i> of the <span class='sc'>Urine</span>; it may
be sufficiently helped by a proper, regular, cooling <i>Diet</i>:
As, if it arises from any <i>undigested</i>, <i>crude Matter</i>; it may
be assisted or reliev’d by a good <i>Draught</i><a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c017'><sup>[77]</sup></a> of <i>warm</i>
generous <i>WINE</i>; which not only helps <i>Concoction</i>, but
also facilitates and promotes <em class='gesperrt'><i>URINE</i></em>: But in case
of absolute <i>Necessity</i>, after all, gentle <span class='sc'>Phlebotomy</span> ought
to be carefully used.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXII.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>COSTIVENESS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Belly</i> discharges it self sometimes more <i>seldom</i>
or infrequently; sometimes with more <i>Pain</i> and
<i>Difficulty</i>; and sometimes in less <i>Quantity</i> than is convenient
for <i>Nature</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THERE</em> have been many <i>Instances</i> given of this
<i>Disorder</i>, by<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c017'><sup>[78]</sup></a>Learned Men, where some <span class='sc'>Patients</span>
have gone to <i>Stool</i> but once in <i>Eight</i>, once in <i>Fourteen</i>,
and once in <i>Twenty</i> or more <i>Days</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span><em class='gesperrt'>YEA</em>,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c017'><sup>[79]</sup></a><i>Dominicus Panarolus</i> relates of a certain
Friend of his, whose <i>Belly</i> was so exsiccated, that he
sometimes liv’d three <i>Months</i> without going to <i>Stool</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> what I mean by <i>Costiveness</i>, is not that Distemper,
where there is a total Suppression, for that
rather belongs to the <i>Iliack Passion</i>; but that only,
where the <i>Excrements</i> lodging longer than their due
natural <i>Time</i>, perhaps three or four Days more or
less, are at last voided hard and dry with some small
Straining.</p>

<p class='c005'>Which irregular <i>Accident</i> may proceed from many
different <i>Causes</i>. Although in the <i>pregnant Woman</i>, I
take the following to be the most <i>Common</i>: That is to
say, the <i>Calidity</i> and <i>Siccity</i> of the <i>LIVER</i>, or <i>SPLEEN</i>;
occasion’d by the <i>Lusty Child’s</i> attracting too much of
the <i>Radical</i> and Succid <i>Moisture</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><i>MOTHER</i></em>,
and compressing the <i>Intestines</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> proves often of dangerous <i>Consequence</i>:
For by the pressing <i>Force</i>, commonly us’d in
such a <i>Case</i> to ease the <span class='sc'>Belly</span>, some <i>Vessels</i> or <i>Ligaments</i>
may be easily and readily <i>broken</i>. And not only so, but
the retain’d <i>Fæces</i> always affect the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, and contaminate
the <span class='sc'>Blood</span> with noxious <i>Vapours</i>; and thereby
impede or hinder the <i>Concoction</i> of the <i>Ventricle</i>, and
the Separation of the better and purer, from the grosser
and impurer part of the <i>Chyle</i>: Whence proceed
many other various <i>Disorders</i> to the whole <i>Body</i>, from
the long Retention of the <i>Excrements</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cure</i> consists in temperating the <i>Calidity</i> of the
<em class='gesperrt'><i>VISCERA</i></em>, and relaxing the <i>BELLY</i> by proper <i>Diet</i>,
<i>Dissolvents</i>, &amp;c. And in <i>Case</i> of any sudden <i>VOMITING</i>,
which sometimes happens upon <i>Costiveness</i>, humectant
and emollient <i>Clysters</i> may be most properly and cautiously
used, to restrain and prevent all such <i>Revulsions</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXIII.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>TENESMS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>A <span class='sc'>Tenesms</span> is an irregular <i>Retention</i> of <span class='sc'>Nature</span>,
and nothing else but a continual <i>Desire</i> or <i>Inclination</i>
of going to <i>STOOL</i>; attended with <i>Pain</i>, without
voiding any thing but <i>Slime</i>, or an indigested
<span class='sc'>Mucosity</span>: And this is in the <span class='sc'>Anus</span>, what a <i>Strangury</i>
is in the <span class='sc'>Bladder</span>; being <i>Both</i> a violent <i>Contraction</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Fibres</span>, or <i>Disorder</i> of the <span class='sc'>Sphincter-Muscles</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> tenacious <i>Symptom</i> proceeds from a great
Variety of <i>Causes</i>, occasionally provoking the <i>expulsive
Faculty</i> of the <i>strait Gut</i>, call’d the <span class='sc'>Rectum</span>, without a
<i>Power</i> to expel; such as may happen to be an unusual
<i>Exulceration</i>, or <i>Constriction</i> of, or an <i>Acid-Salt-Humour</i>
in the same <span class='sc'>Intestine</span>: So likewise a <i>Stone</i> in the Neck
of the <span class='sc'>Bladder</span>, a <i>Tumour</i> of the adjacent <i>Parts</i>, or seminal
<i>Vessels</i>, a frigid <i>Intemperature</i>, the <i>Hemorrhoides</i>, a
<i>Dysenteria</i>, <i>Dysuria</i>, <i>Ischuria</i> or <i>Stranguria</i>, &amp;c. may very
shrewdly occasion the <span class='sc'>Tenesmus</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> binding <i>SYMPTOM</i> is of the same dangerous
<i>Nature</i> and<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c017'><sup>[80]</sup></a><i>Consequence</i> with the preceding
<i>Case</i>; both having an equal <i>Effect</i> of Power, if not prevented,
to expel and dislodge the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>. Which
<i>Notion</i> cannot be otherways better maintain’d; for the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> being situated upon the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Intestinum Rectum</span></i>, must
suffer great <i>Commotions</i> by continual <i>Needings</i> and <i>Strainings</i>
in both Cases.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> the safest <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Cure</span></em>, in short, in my humble
Opinion, is to be perform’d by proper <i>Decoctions</i>, <i>Fomentations</i>,
and absterging <i>Clysters</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXIV.</span><br /> <i>Of the VARICES, or Vein-Tumours.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> is nothing else, than a <i>Distention</i> or
<i>Dilatation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Hip</span>, <span class='sc'>Thigh</span>, and <span class='sc'>Leg-Veins</span>:
Which however chiefly appears about the <span class='sc'>Ham</span>; and it
happens most commonly to <i>Plethorick Women</i>, who walk
much, or exercise themselves more freely upon any
Occasion.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> proceeds only from a <i>Plenty</i>, or <i>Superfluity</i>
of the suppressed <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, more than the <i>Infant</i>
can consume: which being carry’d by the <i>Arteries</i> to
the <i>lower Parts</i>, is thence received by the <i>Crural</i> and
<i>Saphene</i> or <i>Ankle-Veins</i>. Insomuch that the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, being
(by this time) both <i>Ponderous</i> and <i>Bulky</i>, so presseth the
<span class='sc'>Iliac-Veins</span>, that it hinders the <span class='sc'>Blood</span> in its <i>Course</i>,
and obstructs its free <i>Motion</i> and <i>Circulation</i>; whereby
(of consequence) these <i>inferiour Veins</i> must swell and
distend themselves proportionably.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, the <i>Danger</i> of the <i>SYMPTOM</i> is
not great; because after a safe <i>BIRTH</i>, when the super-abounding
<span class='sc'>Blood</span> and <i>Humours</i> are evacuated, these
preternatural <i>Tumours</i> settle, and the <span class='sc'>Veins</span> return to
their <i>Pristine State</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> the only necessary <i>Relief</i> of this
Malady, consists chiefly in the <i>Woman’s</i> abstaining from
too much <i>Walking</i>, and all other extravagant <i>Exercises</i>;
upon indulging her <i>inferiour Limbs</i>, by keeping them
rais’d upon a <i>Couch</i> or <i>Stool</i>, that the <span class='sc'>Blood</span> may not
settle too much to these <i>lower Parts</i>: Or (which is far
better) let her prudently keep her <i>Bed</i>; in which <i>Posture</i>,
the <span class='sc'>Blood</span> can meet with no such <i>Difficulty</i> in
returning by these <i>Veins</i> to the <span class='sc'>Heart</span>, as it will find
when it must ascend by the <i>Woman’s <em class='gesperrt'>SITTING</em></i> or
<em class='gesperrt'><i>STANDING</i></em> upright; so that consequently it must
needs <i>circulate</i> the more readily and with more <i>Ease</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Hence in short, it is, that from this more Free and
Easy <span class='sc'>Circulation</span> in <i>Bed</i>, such <i>Women</i> are always more
easy, or better dispos’d, and far less <i>pain’d</i> or troubled
in the <i>Mornings</i>, than at <i>Nights</i>, in This Condition.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> if, after All, the <i>PATIENT’s</i> Convenience
will not permit such <i>Indulgences</i>, Then a proper <i>Swathe</i>
of three or four Fingers Breadth, is most adviseable;
beginning to <i>swathe</i> this <i>Varicose</i>, or <i>Swelling Part</i>, from
the <i>Bottom upwards</i>, as far as the <i>Varices</i> or <i>Tumours</i> extend.
But in Case of more <i>Plethorick Marks</i>, at last, in
the <i>other Parts</i> of the Body, <i>Phlebotomy</i> may be most
safely made Use of.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXV.</span><br /> <i>Of the INFLATIONS and <em class='gesperrt'>TUMOURS</em> of the <em class='gesperrt'>LEGS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> bloating <i>Symptoms</i> not only happen to
some <i>Women</i> before, but also after <i>BIRTH</i>; especially
when the <span class='sc'>Lochia</span>, or Child-bed Cleansings, do
not flow in a regular <i>Measure</i> or sufficient <i>Quantity</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> of the present disorder’d <i>Case</i>, proceeds
either from the Suppression of some <i>Aqueous Flux</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>; or from some such <i>watery serous</i> <span class='sc'>Blood</span> descending
to the <span class='sc'>Legs</span>; or from the Abundance of retain’d
<i>Menstruous</i> <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, more than the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> can dispense
with: which, being of no Service either to <i>MOTHER</i>
or <i>CHILD</i>, settles downwards to these aggriev’d <i>Parts</i>.
But <i>these Things</i> are to be considered with this Distinction
and Difference, that if the <i>LIVER</i> be debilitated, and
the <span class='sc'>Blood</span> becom’s <i>Pituitous</i> or <i>Aqueous</i>, the <i>Woman</i>’s <span class='sc'>Legs</span>
are so <i>Oedematous</i> or <i>Tumid</i>, that when pressed with the
Finger, it leaves the Impression of a <i>Dent</i> and <i>Hollowness</i>:
But if the <span class='sc'>Blood</span> grows <i>corrupted</i> and <i>bilous</i>, her <span class='sc'>Legs</span>
are <i>inflam’d</i>, and sometimes occasionally <i>exulcerated</i>, as
in <i>Scorbutick Cases</i>: And if none of <i>These</i> happen, then
a gross thick <span class='sc'>Blood</span> only abounds, tending vitiously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>downwards. Upon which there are only some <i>Livid</i>
or <i>Blueish Marks</i><a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c017'><sup>[81]</sup></a> to be discover’d with those <i>Tumours</i>,
such as the <i>VARICES</i> or <i>Swellings</i> occasion in the preceeding
<i>Case</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> fine, the <i>Woman</i> troubled with these <i>Symptoms</i>,
commonly bears a <i>Female</i>; as all <i>Women</i>, having sickly
times of <i>GESTATION</i>, generally do. However yet,
tho’ this swelling <i>Affection</i> is very troublesome, its <i>Danger</i>
is not great; because it ordinarily ceases of it self
with good Care after the <i>BIRTH</i>. Wherefore in this
Condition a <i><em class='gesperrt'>CURE</em></i> is not always to be attempted, lest
the <i>Humours</i> recoiling upwards, affect some <i>nobler Part</i>.
Nevertheless, if the <i>SWELLING</i> be too considerably
Painful or Troublesome, proper <i>Digerents</i> and <i>Discutients</i>
may be apply’d, and the <span class='sc'>Legs</span> fomented with a
convenient <i>Lixivy</i>, <i>Decoction</i>, or <i>Cataplasm</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> only happens to <i>Women</i> bearing

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> proceeds only from the <i>natural Lenitude</i>
and <i>Constriction</i> of the Skin of the <i>ABDOMEN</i> or

towards the <i>latter Months</i>, it gives way to such a large

by its thin <i>Attenuation</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> it occasions also very often great

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXVII.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>WATER-FLUXES</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Water</i> which is gather’d in the Time of
<i>GESTATION</i>, between the <i>Membranes</i> involving
the <i>INFANT</i>, is at last upon the approaching <i>BIRTH</i>
effus’d: For the <i>CHILD</i> having broke the <span class='sc'>Amnion</span>,
feels these <em class='gesperrt'><i>WATERS</i></em> troublesome, and consequently
obliges the <span class='sc'>Chorion</span> also to give way. From whence
proceeds naturally a <i>copious Effusion</i> of the same <span class='sc'>Waters</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> of this natural <i>Flooding</i>, I am not properly
to treat in this Place; only of <i>that</i> preposterous <span class='sc'>Flux</span>,
which happens before the due time of <i>BIRTH</i>, the
<i>immediate Cause</i> of which proceeds from some <i>Procatarctick
Accident</i>: Such as a <i>Perturbation of Mind</i>, an
unlucky <i>Fall</i>, a <i>Leap</i>, a <i>Stroke</i>, or any other Violence.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Symptom</i> happens <i>Two ways</i>, either by a
<i>Disruption</i>, or <i>Dilatation</i> of the <i>MEMBRANES</i>: the
<i>first</i> by <i>external</i>, the other commonly by <i>internal Causes</i>.
In the <i>first Case</i>, the <span class='sc'>Flux</span> comes suddenly, irregularly,
and in a great <i>Quantity</i>; in the <i>second</i>, by little and little,
or by degrees, and less in <i>Quantity</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>first Case</i> is most dangerous, being the infallible
<i>PROGNOSTICK</i> of instant <i>Abortion</i>, if not timely
and judiciously prevented. The <i>second Case</i> is of the
following bad <i>Consequence</i>, that this <span class='sc'>Water</span>, which has
hitherto defended the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> from the <i>Rigidity</i> of the
circumjacent <i>Parts</i>, being at last (how leisurely soever)
exhausted and spent; the <span class='sc'>Child</span> is soon sensible of its
<i>Loss</i>, and finding its wonted <span class='sc'>Seat</span> become uneasy, it
thereupon being restless or discontented, endeavours to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>move and seek for a <i>Better</i>: By which means (if <i>Abortion</i>
does not presently ensue) it falls into a <i>preternatural Situation</i>,
which (of course) occasions a <i>preternatural BIRTH</i>.
But abstracting from <i>This</i>, the bare <i>Deficiency</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Waters</span>, for moistening the <i>Passages</i> in time of <i>LABOUR</i>,
is enough to effect the same Unhappiness.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, the <i>Cure</i> of this <i>SYMPTOM</i> depends
chiefly upon a good <i>Regimen</i> of <i>DIET</i>, and <i>external</i>,
as well as <i>internal Corroboratives</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> short, having thus discuss’d the several <i>SYMPTOMS</i>
of the Nine <i>Months</i>, and such as are most
common and familiar to the <i>Woman</i> during her <span class='sc'>Foetura</span>,
or the whole Time of her <i>CHILD-BEARING</i>; I shall
proceed now in the next Place with all due <i>Method</i> and
peculiar <i>Regard</i> for her <span class='sc'>Good</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXVIII.</span><br /> <i>Of Acute <em class='gesperrt'>DISEASES</em> incident to the <em class='gesperrt'>CHILD-BEARING WOMAN</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> sometimes, and more than too often, happens,
that besides the common <i>SYMPTOMS</i> of the <i>Months</i>,
the <i>conceiv’d Woman</i> is also suddenly taken with some
<i>acute DISEASE</i> or other; upon which I shall offer my
sincere <i>Opinion</i>, and according to the best of my Judgment,
give a brief <i>Account</i> of <i>Those</i> several <i>Maladies</i>,
with their <i>Definition</i> and <i>Cause</i>, <i>Nature</i> and <i>Quality</i>,
<i>Danger</i> and <span class='sc'>Cure</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em> then, the great <i>Galen</i> defines <i>acute DISEASES</i>
to be such, whose <i>Motion is swift</i>, attended
with sudden and immediate <i>Danger</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> learned <i>Brassavole</i> calls such <i><em class='gesperrt'>DISEASES</em>
Acute</i>, as come <i>suddenly</i>, continue a <i>short Time</i>, and have
very severe or violent <i>SYMPTOMS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> ingenious <i>Blancard</i> calls those <i>DISEASES
Acute</i>, which are <i>over in a little Time</i>, but not without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span><i>imminent Danger</i>. Now <i>Those</i> are deem’d either <i>very
Acute</i>, or <i>most Acute</i>; the <i>latter</i> is meant when the <i>Distemper</i>
is over the 4th <i>Day</i>; but the <i>former</i> is that which
continues till the 7th <i>Day</i>: For the more <i>acute</i> the <i>DISEASE</i>
is, the sooner follows its <i>Determination</i>, either
for Life or Death. Again, a Disease is call’d <i>simply
acute</i>, when it lasts 14 or 21 <i>Days</i>; or lastly, it is
term’d <i>Acute ex decidentiâ</i>, which lasts 42 Days at least.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> according to the diligent Dr. <i>Sydenham</i><a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c017'><sup>[82]</sup></a>, the
<i>Despumation</i> of <i>Acute DISEASES</i> happens in 336 <i>Hours</i>;
which he also justly applies to <i>intermitting FEVERS</i>,
reckoning 5 Hours and a half for a <i>Paroxysm</i>: Because
what we call <span class='sc'>Days</span> in <i>Acute Fevers</i>, are so many <span class='sc'>Periods</span>
in <i>intermitting Fevers</i>: The only difference of <i>Those</i> consisting
in that the <i>one</i> perfects its <i>Fermentation</i> at <i>once</i>,
which the <i>other</i> accomplishes at reiterated <i>Times</i>, and
divers <i>Turns</i>, by the same Duct of <i>Nature</i>. He farther
still, observes that <i>Autumnal Quartan Fevers</i> continue six
Months; in which Time, if the Number of the recurrent
<i>Paroxysms</i> be summed up, they will exactly amount
to the aforesaid 336 Hours, or 14 Days, which is the
<i>Term</i> or <i>End</i> of the regular and <i>continual Fevers</i> of that
Season.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> the wise <span class='sc'>Hippocrates</span> observes<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c017'><sup>[83]</sup></a> that as an
exquisite <i>continual Fever</i> ceases within the 7th Day, so
an exquisite <i>Tertian</i> has seven <i>periodical Circuits</i>; because
every <i>Access</i> in the latter, makes up a <i>Day</i> in the former
Case. Hence it is manifest that all <i>Epidemick Diseases</i>
have their due and regular <i>Times</i><a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c017'><sup>[84]</sup></a> of encreasing,
continuing, and decreasing; and that These <i>Laws</i> of
<i>Nature</i> are so constant and permanent, that however
<i>Fevers</i> differ in other Circumstances, they are equal as
to the Duration of <i>Time</i>; counting according to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span><i>Periods</i> or Fits of the <i>intermitting</i>, and the continued
Number of <i>Days</i> of the never <i>intermitting Fever</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>GALEN</em><a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c017'><sup>[85]</sup></a> further explains <i>Acute DISEASES</i>, and
calls them <i>Two-fold</i>: The <i>one</i> attended with a continual
<span class='sc'>Fever</span>; such as are <i>burning Fevers</i>, <i>Frenzies</i>, <i>Lethargies</i>,
<i>Pleurisies</i>, <i>Squincies</i>, <i>Inflammations</i>, &amp;c. The <i>other</i> without
any Fever, such as <i>Epilepsies</i>, <i>Apoplexies</i>, <i>Convulsions</i>,
<i>Palsies</i>, <i>Contraction of LIMBS</i>, <i>JOINTS</i>, &amp;c. Now the<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c017'><sup>[86]</sup></a>
<i>Accesses</i> and <i>Crises</i> of all <i>These</i> proceed from the <i>Influence</i>
of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span>; which in over-ruling terrestrial
Things, surpasses all the other <span class='sc'>Planets</span> and <span class='sc'>Stars</span>, not
so much because of her <i>Power</i>, as by her <i>Approximation</i>
or <i>Vicinity</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> of both the <i>one</i> and the <i>other</i> seems to
be the <i>same</i>; tho’ it <i>affecteth differently</i>, according to
the various <i>Regimen</i> and <i>Disposition</i> of the Woman:
And it most probably proceeds either from the <i>vitious
Humours</i>, which have abounded in the Body before <i>Conception</i>;
or from such <i>Humours</i> as have been congested
afterwards by the <i>suppressed</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Menses</em></span>, or <i>Months</i>: Which
being irritated by improper or depraved <i>Food</i>, by bad
or negligent <i>Regimen</i>, either before or after <i>Conception</i>;
those <i>Humours</i> (like <i>Yest</i> in <i>Ale</i>) ferment the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span>, to
such a Degree, that (all on a sudden) the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span> is
violently taken with one or other of those <i>Acute</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Diseases</em></span>,
which are determined by a certain <i>Lunary</i>
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Crisis</span></em>; that is to say, by a certain <i>Motion</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Nature</span></em>,
accelerated by the <i>Power</i> of the <span class='sc'>Moon</span>, to a gradual
<i>Expulsion</i> of the <i>peccant Matter</i> thro’ the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Pores</span></em> of the
Body. But this <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Crisis</span></em>, in short, happens always with
most Ease and Safety upon the <i>New</i> or <i>Full-Moon</i>, because
the ambient <i>Air</i> does not at that time so much
affect the <i>Superficies</i> of the Body, nor so violently repress
the <i>Motion</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Fluids</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, this melancholy <i>Accident</i> can never
happen worse than to the <i>Conceiv’d Woman</i>; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span><i>farther</i> she is gone in her Time, the more <i>Danger</i> still.
And that because of the <i>Scarcity</i> or <i>Want</i> of <i>pure</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Blood</span></em>,
which ought to be imbibed by the <i>Infant</i>, either in
part or in whole, according to its Age and Strength: Or,
because of the <i>Plenty</i> of <i>vitious</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Blood</span></em>, which tends to
no other end, than to <i>imbecilitate</i> the Woman, and
render her <i>incapable</i> of suffering the <i>Insults</i> of such <i>acute</i>
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Diseases</span></em>. For <i>Nature</i> may (perhaps) be able to bear
up against <i>one simple Effect</i>, but when it is joined and
aggravated by <i>another</i>, the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Patient</span></em> is too often obliged
to <i>succumb</i>, and yield herself up to be <i>overpower’d</i>
in the Struggle of Life.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em>, after all yet, <i>acute</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Diseases</span></em> are not always
<i>mortal</i> to the <i>Conceived Woman</i>; for, as Experience teaches,
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Some</span></em> have the good Fortune to <i>escape</i>, tho’ indeed
the Odds<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c017'><sup>[87]</sup></a> are very great on the other Side. But
of such sharp <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Maladies</span></em>, <i>those</i> without any <i>Fever</i> are
reckoned most <i>dangerous</i>; because they are not only
<i>Acute</i>, but also <i>most Acute</i>: And by <i>those</i> the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Mother</span></em>
is more immediately endangered than the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Infant</span></em>;
whereas by <i>those</i> which come with a <i>Fever</i>, the tender
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Infant</span></em> is first and chiefly endangered, because of the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Mother</span></em>’s internal <i>Calidity</i> and <i>Depravation</i>, which easily
affects, and soon suffocates or stifles it in a short time.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, it is very observable, that a <i>Woman</i><a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c017'><sup>[88]</sup></a>,
bearing a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Female</span></em>, is more readily seized, and
more easily freed or cured of <i>acute</i> <span class='sc'>Diseases</span>, than <i>she</i>
who bears a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Male</span></em>: And that because <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Females</span></em> are
naturally more obnoxious to <i>Distempers</i>, proceeding
from the <i>Retention</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Menstrua</span></em>, and consequently
more <i>favourably affected</i>, because of the <i>natural Affinity</i>
and <i>Familiarity</i> of the Case.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> this is the Reason that <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Females</span></em>, after the
<i>first Months</i>, do bear and sustain more <i>Pains</i> than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span><em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Males</span></em>; as daily Experience confirms, in that a <i>Female
Miscarriage</i><a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c017'><sup>[89]</sup></a> seldom happens after the <i>first Months</i>:
whereas the <i>Male Abortion</i> is most of all to be feared,
after the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Time</span></em> of <i>Motion</i> or <i>Animation</i>, because the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Acetabula</span></em>, or <i>Cavities</i>, being then more <i>siccid</i>, are
the more easily broken by its <i>stronger Motion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> Cases of <i>Acute</i> <span class='sc'>Diseases</span>, the worst is, that the
necessary <i>Helps</i>, which such incident <i>Distempers</i> otherways
absolutely require, are not always safe and convenient
for the <i>Child-bearing Woman</i>: which Condition,
(with respect to the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Cure</span></em>) renders the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Case</span></em> one of
the <i>nicest Points</i> in the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Art</span></em> of <i>Physick</i>. Wherefore I
would, with Submission, advise, that <i>none</i> but the ablest
and well-qualified <i>Physician</i> should undertake either the
<i>Care</i> or the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Cure</span></em> of such a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Patient</span></em>. To whom I
am not to prescribe <i>Rules</i>, and therefore I shall only
refer him to his own more <i>Acute Judgment</i>, and the <i>Curious
Solutions</i> of (that most learned <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Physician</span></em>) <i>Daniel
Senertus</i><a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c017'><sup>[90]</sup></a>, upon the <i>six following Questions</i>, thus stated
by himself, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>HOW</em> <i>far slender Diet is convenient for the Child-bearing
Woman</i>, <i>labouring under an acute Disease?</i></p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>HOW</em> <i>far it is convenient to open a Vein or bleed
this Woman upon such an Occasion?</i></p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>HOW</em> <i>far it may be proper to purge her on the
same Occasion?</i></p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>WHETHER</em> <i>Venæ-Sections or Purges are most
dangerous in such a Case?</i></p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>WHETHER</em> <i>it is practicable</i> (<i>in such a dangerous

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>HOW</em> <i>far Clysters</i>, <i>Diureticks</i>, <i>and Diaphoreticks

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HAVING</em>, thus, now, in fine, briefly hinted upon
the <i>sundry</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Heads</span></em> of this <i>Chapter</i>, I shall, in the next

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXIX.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>DEBILITY</em> and <em class='gesperrt'>WEAKNESS</em> of the</i> Fœtus.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>BESIDES</em> all the enumerated <span class='sc'>Symptoms</span>, <i>Acute</i>
and <i>Chronical Distempers</i>, to which the <i>Child-bearing
Woman</i> is subject; it also happens over and above (too
frequently) that the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> becomes <i>Weak</i> and <i>Sick</i>
in the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> of which unhappy <i>Accident</i> I take to be
<i>fourfold</i>: As it proceeds, either from a <i>Debility</i> and <i>Insufficiency</i>
of the <i>Parental</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span>, or from a <i>Scarcity</i> or
<i>Want</i> of requisite <i>Sustenance</i>, or from a certain <i>Depravation</i>
of that <i>Sustenance</i>, or from some immediate <i>Procatarctick
Cause</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mother</em></span>; which may all be thus
rationally distinguished, and severally accounted for;
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> certainly lies in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span>, if the <i>Woman</i>
has continued always <i>healthy</i>, eating, drinking, and
living regularly.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> may be imputed to the <i>Scarcity</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Aliment</em></span>, if
she has often laboured under <i>Diseases</i>, or been exposed
to <i>Hunger</i>, <i>Want</i>, <i>Penury</i>, or any such like manifest retrenching
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Cause</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> may be adjudged to a <i>Depravity</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Aliment</span></em>,
when the <i>Woman</i> (by a vitiated Constitution of Body)
is subject to some certain <i>Distempers</i>; and, besides, in
short, any <i>Procatarctick Cause</i> is discoverable from the
<i>Relation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Patient</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> whatever the <i>Cause</i> may be, the <i>Diagnostick
Signs</i> of this unhappy <i>Affection</i>, are commonly <i>One</i> or
<i>more</i> of the following <span class='sc'>Six</span>; <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>1. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> turgid swell’d <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Breasts</em></span> of the <i>Pregnant
Woman</i>, all on a sudden<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c017'><sup>[91]</sup></a>, fall and extenuate into a <i>Flabbiness</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>2.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c017'><sup>[92]</sup></a><em class='gesperrt'>THEY</em> diffuse copiously a thin <i>Waterish Milk</i>,
not half digested to its due Perfection.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Menstrua</i> return at an uncommon <i>Rate</i>,
and in an irregular <i>Manner</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Woman</i> personally is either very frequently
<i>Sick</i>, or long expos’d to a lasting <i>Sickness</i>. Or,</p>

<p class='c005'>5. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> is either subject to a very frequent, or long
continu’d <i>Looseness</i>, and constant <i>Diarrhæa</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Infant</i> which used (as it ought) to <i>move
briskly</i>, is now but very <i>seldom</i>, and more <i>faintly</i> perceiv’d
in <i>Motion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ON</em> the other hand, the <i>Prognosticks</i> of this <span class='sc'>Case</span>,
are briefly <i>Two</i>: For either <i>Abortion</i> follows, or (which

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>WOMEN</em> <i>miscarry</i> so frequently, that if any curious
Persons will diligently observe and examine
that <i>Matter</i>, they will find the Number of <span class='sc'>Miscarriages</span>
to exceed <i>That</i> of <i>timely</i> <span class='sc'>Births</span>: Wherefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>I have reason to think, that this <i>Head</i> deserves to be
handled more at large, and to be more particularly insisted
upon, in the following manner.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Modern Practisers</i> in <i>MIDWIFERY</i>, distinguish
<span class='sc'>Miscarriages</span>, by <i>four</i> different <i>Appellations</i>; according
to the <i>four</i> different <i>Times</i> of the <i>Constitution</i> of the <i>CONCEPTION</i>.
viz.</p>

<p class='c005'>A <span class='sc'>Miscarriage</span> happening in the Time of <i>Spumification</i>,
is call’d an <i>Effluxion of the <em class='gesperrt'>GENITURA</em></i>: That
which happeneth in the <i>Vegetation</i>, or Time of <i>Ramification</i>,
or (as some will have it) before the 40th <i>Day</i>,
is call’d a <i>Deperdition</i> of the <span class='sc'>Embryo</span>: <i>That</i> which falls
out in the <i>sensitive</i> Progression, or Time of <i>Carnification</i>,
or (as others will have it) before the <i>90th Day</i> from
<i>CONCEPTION</i>, they call an <i>Abortion</i> of the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span>.
But what so happens afterwards preceding the <i>7th
Month</i>, is properly call’d an entire <i>Abortion</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Infant</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, <i>Others</i> will have a <i>fifth Distinction</i>
made; namely, what so happens in the 7th, 8th, and
preceding the 20th Day of the 9th <i>Month</i>, to be call’d
an untimely <i>BIRTH</i>; because tho’ born with <i>Life</i>, they
alledge it to be very seldom, or never really <i>Vital</i>, or
likely to <i>Live</i>: Upon which I shall, in good Time, introduce
my own <i>Sentiment</i> in the subsequent Chapters of
this <i>Section</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOTWITHSTANDING</em>, this <i>Definition</i> signifies
but little to the Purpose; let the <i>MISCARRIAGE</i>
happen when it will, and under whatsoever <i>Name</i> or
<i>Denomination</i>, It is nothing else in general, than an
untimely <i>Exclusion</i> of an imperfect and immature <span class='sc'>Birth</span>;
which unhappy <i>Accident</i> may proceed from a vast Variety
of <i>Causes</i>, stimulating <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nature</em></span> to such a violent
<i>Expulsion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> treating therefore of this <i>Accidental <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>, I
shall make use of none of those <i>Distinctions</i>; but rather
(to prevent Mistakes) shall call all its several <span class='sc'>Species</span>,
of whatsoever <i>Time</i>, by the general (and most common)
Name of <i>ABORTION</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> of this <i>ABORTION</i>, happen when it will,
the <i>proximous Cause</i> is always the <i>Expulsive Faculty</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; which being <i>hurt</i>, or violently <i>disorder’d</i> in
any respect, irritates and debilitates the <i>Retentive Power</i>:
And then again, on the other hand, this <i>Retentive Faculty</i>
(tho’ not the <i>proximous Cause</i>) is sometimes <i>first
hurt</i> or <i>injur’d</i>, and by that means incapacitated to
<i>retain</i> the <i>INFANT</i>; which (in that Case) offends and
provokes the <i>Expulsive Power</i><a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c017'><sup>[93]</sup></a>, which is the proper <i>proximous
Cause</i> of all <i>ABORTIONS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> most commonly the <i>Expulsive</i> receives the
<i>First Hurt</i>; from whence the <i>Retentive</i> is oblig’d to <i>Sympathize</i>,
and yield to its over-ruling <i>Motions</i>. And,
according to <i>Galen</i><a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c017'><sup>[94]</sup></a>, the <i>Expulsive Faculty</i> may be injur’d
and irritated by <i>Three</i> different <i>Causes</i>; viz. 1. By
the <i>Bulk</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, when the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> cannot distend
itself far enough to contain it: 2. By its <i>Weight</i>,
when heavier than the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and <i>Ligaments</i> can bear:
And, 3. By the <i>Humours</i> (when the <i>Membranes</i> break)
flowing into the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; occasioning a <i>Mordacious Itching</i>
there, or <i>putrefying</i> the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> in its Place.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>TO</em> which <i>three Efficients</i>, some Modern Authors
have thought it sufficient to add the <i>similar</i>, <i>organical</i>,
and <i>common Diseases</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; together with some
<i>Procatarctick Causes</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, because I have generally observ’d
<i>Those</i>, to be very promiscuously and confusedly treated
of, I shall (according to my best Ability) endeavour to
reduce the many different <i>Causes</i> of <i>ABORTION</i> to such
plain <i>Heads</i>, and set them in such a clear <i>Light</i>, that
they shall prove evident and manifest to the meanest
<i>Capacity</i>: That <i>Women</i> (whose peculiar <i>Good</i> I have
only at Heart in the Performance of this Work) may
readily conceive them, and thereby be enabled (in most
<i>Cases</i>) to prevent their greatest <i>Misfortunes</i>. And that
whether the <i>Cause</i> happens proximously and immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>from a <i>stimulated Expulsive</i>, or mediately from a
<i>læs’d</i> and <i>injur’d Retentive Faculty</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> I shall now reduce those <i>Causes</i>
to the following <i>Four general Heads</i>; namely, 1. To the
<i>Constitution</i> of the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>: 2. The <i>Constitution</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Infant</span>: 3. The <i>Symptoms</i> of the <span class='sc'>Months</span>: And, 4.
To the various <i>Procatarctick Causes</i> of this Tragical
Case.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em> the <i>Causes of <em class='gesperrt'>ABORTION</em></i>, proceeding
from the <i>Constitution</i> of the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>, are <i>Three-fold</i>, and
respect either her <i>whole Body</i>, her <span class='sc'>Womb</span> only, or its
<i>neighbouring Parts</i>. <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Those</em></span> respecting her <i>whole Body</i>,
are,</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>four Intemperatures</i> of the Body; as the
<span class='sc'>Calid</span>, which, by its <i>Hot Quality</i>, exhausts the <i>Humours</i>
(that are naturally necessary) to the Prejudice and Loss
of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Frigid</span>; which, by its <i>Cold Quality</i>, vitiates
and attenuates the <span class='sc'>Infant’s</span> <i>Aliment</i>, to a starving
Condition.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Siccid</span>; which, by its <i>adust dry Quality</i>,
scorches and consumes the <i>Ligaments</i>, that they break,
like so many <i>Strings</i> that snap before the <i>Sun</i>: Upon
which the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> (being deprived of those <i>Mediums</i>,
through which <span class='sc'>Nature</span> has appointed its <i>Sustenance</i>)
corrupts and decays, like a <i><em class='gesperrt'>PLANT</em></i> in <i>Arid Sandy
Ground</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Humid</span> <i>Intemperature</i>; which, by its
<i>moist Quality</i>, debilitates the <i>Retentive Faculty</i>, hinders
the <i>Ligaments</i> to consolidate and close firmly, and opens
the shut <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>. But besides all This
also, by filling the <i>ACETABULA</i> with <i>superfluous Humours</i>,
it may suffocate and stifle the <i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. A <i>nimious</i> and too great an <i>Obesity</i> or <i>Fatness</i>,
and too great a <i>Gracility</i> or <i>Leanness</i> of the <i>Woman</i>’s
Body: For the <i>One</i> converts the <i>CHILD</i>’s <i>Nourishment</i>
to itself; and the <i>Other</i> starves the <i>INFANT</i> for
want of its <i>natural Requisites</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>VI. A <i>PLETHORY</i>, or too great a <i>Repletion</i> of <span class='sc'>Blood</span>
in her Body; which frequently choaks and suffocates
the <i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> <i>Corporeal Causes</i>, exagitating the <i>Spirits</i>
and <i>Humours</i>; which have the same <i>Effect</i> and <i>Force</i> to
irritate the <i>Expulsive Faculty</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> <i>Diseases</i> incident to the Body, whether
they be <i>Acute</i>, <i>Remiss</i>, or <i>Diuturnal</i>; which may
easily effect <i>ABORTION</i>. But</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, The <i>Causes</i> on the part of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, are not to be lightly or slightly considered;
because if it be not both naturally well <i>constituted</i>, and
carefully well <i>dispos’d</i>, it can neither foment, cherish,
nor retain the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>. For the least <i>Flaw</i> of its <i>morbifick
Causes</i>, stimulates to a great Degree the <i>expulsive
Faculty</i>: which <i>Causes</i> are, in my Opinion, as follow;
viz.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Womb</span>’s <i>Præternatural <em class='gesperrt'>SIZE</em></i>, either in
<i>Magnitude</i>, or <i>Exiguity</i>: The <i>one</i> giving room for the
<i>Infant</i>’s too much tumbling or too frequent Motion; and
the <i>other</i> restraining the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i> too much, even to the
<i>suppressing</i> and <i>stifling</i> of it.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>ITS</em> <i>præternatural</i> <i>CONSTRICTION</i> or <i>Coarctation</i>;
which may resist its necessary due <i>Extension</i>, for
containing the growing <span class='sc'>Infant</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>ITS</em> <i>præternatural</i> <i><em class='gesperrt'>DENSITY</em></i>; which may not
only hinder the requisite <i>Distention</i>, but also prevent
the <span class='sc'>Secundine</span><a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c017'><sup>[95]</sup></a> from being firmly connected to the
<i>Vessels</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>ITS</em> <i><em class='gesperrt'>LAXITY</em></i> of the <i>Orifice</i>, or <i>Lavity</i> of the
interiour <i>Surface</i>; proceeding from <i>pituitous</i><a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c017'><sup>[96]</sup></a> or <i>viscous
Humours</i>, which slacken the <i>Ligaments</i>, and give way to
the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>V. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Womb’s</span> too <i>frigid</i> and <i>siccid Intemperature</i>;
which Qualities are the greatest Enemies to <i>Nature</i> and
all the <i>Actions</i> of <i>Female LIFE</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>ITS</em> <i>frigid</i> and <i>humid Intemperature</i>; which (abounding
with <i>Mucosities</i> or <i>slimy Humours</i>) so relaxes
the <i>Ligaments</i>, that they cannot hold or detain the
<i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> obdurated and confirmed <i>Tumours</i> and
<i>Ulcers</i>, all <i>Erysipelas</i> and <i>Inflammations</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>:
Which often prove the <i>Causes</i> of the same <i>Effect</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. A <i>præternatural Situation</i>, or an <i>oblique Position</i>
may become the <i>8th</i> and <i>last Cause</i> of <i>ABORTION</i>,
which I shall mention on part of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> hence I come, <i>Thirdly</i>, in a due Method,
to <i>Those Causes</i> respecting the <i>neighbouring Parts</i>; which
I humbly conceive to be as follow.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> <i>Diseases</i>, <i>Pains</i>, and what <i>Causes</i> soever of
those <i>Parts</i>, may tend much to deject or affect the <i>Spirits</i>,
and stir up the <i>Humours</i> with unusual Alteration.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> <i>Causes</i> and bad <i>Affections</i> compressing the
<i>lower Belly</i>, and exagitating or straining its <span class='sc'>Muscles</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. A <i>præternatural Site</i> and inapt <i>CONFORMATION</i><a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c017'><sup>[97]</sup></a>
of the <i>Umbilical Vessels</i>, for their due Operation.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> then again, <i>Secondly</i>, It also often happens
that, tho’ the <i>pregnant Woman</i> labours under no <i>Disease</i>
or <i>Misfortune</i>, either in <span class='sc'>Body</span>, <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, or <i>neighbouring</i>
<span class='sc'>Parts</span>, yet notwithstanding the <i>Expulsive Faculty</i> is irritated
to <span class='sc'>Ejection</span> by several <i>Causes</i> of the <i>Constitution</i>
of the <i>INFANT</i> itself, as follow; <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>ITS</em> <i>præternatural</i> <span class='sc'>Bulk</span>, or vitious <i>Conformation</i>,
oppressing and straining the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, either in <i>Whole</i> or
in <i>Part</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>ITS</em> <i>Debility</i> and <i>Weakness</i>, or contracted, infirm,
feeble <i>Constitution</i>, as mentioned in the preceding
<i>Chapter</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>III. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Death</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>, emitting nauseous
<i>Vapours</i> and putrefy’d <i>Matter</i>, stimulates the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
sooner or later to <i>Expulsion</i>: And (in this <i>tragical Case</i>)
the <i>sooner</i> the <i>Better</i>; as will hereafter appear.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> moreover, <i>Thirdly</i>, the <i>SYMPTOMS</i> of the
<i>Months</i>, frequently prove <i>Causes</i> of <i>ABORTION</i>; of
which <i>SYMPTOMS</i>, having already treated particularly,
I shall in this place repeat little or nothing, only
refer the <span class='sc'>Reader</span> to their respective <i>Chapters</i> in the
preceding <i>Part</i> of this <span class='sc'>Section</span>: And yet under this
present <i>Head</i>, may be also comprehended all <i>Acute Diseases</i>,
which (too often) prove of the same bad <i>Consequence</i>;
as is evident from Chap. 28.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOURTHLY</em>, There is a great <i>Variety</i> of <i>Procatarctick
Causes</i>, distinct from all <i>those</i> above-mentioned,
which most frequently occasion <i>ABORTION</i>: And
<i>Those</i> are <i>Two-fold</i>, <i>INTERNAL</i> and <i>EXTERNAL</i>. Of
which the <i>Internal</i> are as follow, in my Judgment.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Passions</i> of the Mind (mentioned in <span class='sc'>Sect.</span> I.
<i>Chap.</i> 5.) because such immoderate <i>Affections</i> too much
excite the <i>Humours</i>, and incense the <i>Spirits</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>VICTUALS</em>; if taken <i>too much</i> at a time,
suffocate the <i>INFANT</i>; if <i>too little</i>, it is <i>starved</i>, and
the <i>MOTHER</i> brought to a very low Condition of
Life; and if <i>improper</i>, or of ill <i>Concoction</i>, the <i>CHILD</i>
is thereby either much <i>weaken’d</i>, or (which is worse) it
dies of course.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>DRINKING</em> immoderately, extinguisheth
the <i>natural Calidity</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and the <i>INFANT</i>;
as certainly <i>strong</i> or <i>hot Liquors</i> impress a vitious <i>Intemperature</i>
upon <i>Both</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>WATCHINGS</em> a-Nights, too much exhaust
and dissipate the <i>Spirits</i>; as too much <span class='sc'>Sleep</span>, on
the other hand, dulls, lessens, and obtunds the <i>natural
Heat</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> inward disorderly <i>Causes</i> dissolving the
<i>Uterine</i> <span class='sc'>Acetabula</span>, <i>Ligaments</i>, or <i>Vessels</i>, by which the
<i>INFANT</i> attracts its <i>Nourishment</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> <i>Venenated</i>, <i>Cathartick</i>, and <i>Diaphoretick
<em class='gesperrt'>MEDICINES</em></i>, <i>Acrimonious Clysters</i>, <i>Venæ-Sections</i>,
<i>Baths</i>, &amp;c: Which partly by exagitating the <i>Spirits</i> and
<i>Humours</i>, and partly by diminishing the <i>Aliment</i>, occasion
frequent <i>ABORTIONS</i>. Again</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>external Procatarctick Causes</i> are These, which
ensue in their due Order.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> inclement <i>Constitutions</i> or bad <i>Influences</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Weather</span>, <span class='sc'>Winds</span>,<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c017'><sup>[98]</sup></a>and <span class='sc'>Air</span>; such as <i>Cold</i>, which
pinches; or as <i>Heat</i>, which intercepts the <i>Breath</i>, and
stifles the <i>INFANT</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>SMELLING</em> or <i>Touching</i>, <i>Sitting</i>, or <i>Treading</i> upon
some Sorts of pernicious <span class='sc'>Herbs</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> violent <span class='sc'>Motions</span>, immoderate <i>Exercises</i>,
&amp;c. such as <i>Running</i>, <i>Leaping</i>, <i>Dancing</i>, <i>Riding</i>, or <i>Coaching</i>,
<i>Lifting</i>, or <i>Carrying a heavy Weight</i>, also <i>long Fasting</i>,
<i>strait Lacing</i>, a <i>Fall</i>, a <i>Blow</i> on the <i>Back</i> or the <i>Belly</i>,
&amp;c. as I hinted before occasionally.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> <i>frightful</i> <span class='sc'>Objects</span>, and <i>sudden Surprizes</i> by
hasty <span class='sc'>News</span>, <span class='sc'>Fire</span>, or such like terrifying Accidents.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> <i>astonishing</i> and terrible affecting <i>NOISES</i>;
such as sudden Claps of <i>Thunder</i>, <i>Cannons</i>, <i>Guns</i> &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> nauseous <span class='sc'>Stinks</span>, on the one hand, and
odoriferous <span class='sc'>Smells</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i> on the other, being <i>both</i> disagreeable
and dangerous.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THOSE</em>, and many other <i>trifling Matters</i>, such as
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Smell</span></em> of an <i>extinguished Light</i>, or <i>Candle</i>, are
known (too often) to be the <i>Reason</i> and <i>Cause</i> of
<i>ABORTION</i>: which made (that great <i>Naturalist</i>) <i>Pliny</i><a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c017'><sup>[99]</sup></a>
 justly take occasion to deplore the <span class='sc'>Frailty</span> of Man.</p>

<p class='c005'>“<em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> bewails and is asham’d (as he expresseth it)
to think how <i>frivolous</i> the <i>ORIGIN</i> of the <i>proudest of
Creatures</i> is; such a mere <span class='sc'>Trifle</span> (as is mentioned)
being frequently the <i>Cause</i> of his <i>FATALITY</i>. And
the <i>Philosopher</i> most pertinently adds, that <i>He</i> who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>now glories in so many <i>VANITIES</i>, trusting in the
<i>Strength</i> of his <i>Body</i>, vaunting in the <i>Riches</i> of his
<i>Possessions</i>, and upon every <i>Smile of Fortune</i>, believes
himself to be a <span class='sc'>God</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i> little considers how many
ways he might have <i>miscarried</i> in coming into the
World, or how many ways he may yet, even to-day,
go out of it, and come to his <i>last GASP</i>, as <i>Anacreon</i>,
the wanton <i>Lyrick Poet</i>, did, who was suddenly
choak’d with the <span class='sc'>Stone</span> <i>of a Grape</i>; or as <i>Fabius</i>
(that noble <i>Dictator</i> of <span class='sc'>Rome</span>) dy’d, who was immediately
strangl’d by a <i>HAIR</i> in a <i>Draught of Milk</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I say, <i>He</i> little considers, how many <i>Trials</i> and <i>Hardships</i>
he was expos’d to, before he had <span class='sc'>Being</span>: or, how
many ways he might have been <i>stifled</i> before he had
<span class='sc'>Breath</span>, and have been <i>dead</i> even before he was <span class='sc'>Born</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> Consideration leads me to the Thought
of <i>another Cause</i> of <i>ABORTION</i>, mentioned by the holy
Prophet<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c017'><sup>[100]</sup></a><i>Hosea</i>, where he says: “<i>Because they have
deeply corrupted themselves, and separated themselves unto
that Shame at</i> Baalpeor, (i. e. defiled themselves at
the <i>Statues</i> of <span class='sc'>Priapus</span>) <i>their Glory shall fly away like a
Bird, from the</i> Womb, <i>from the</i> Conception, <i>and from
the</i> Birth; <i>dry Breasts, and a miscarrying</i> Womb <i>shall
be given them</i>, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> having thus far briefly defin’d and descanted
upon <i>ABORTION</i>, and the <i>Nature</i> of its <i>Efficients</i>, I
come now, in the next place, to shew by what <i>DIAGNOSTICK
SIGNS</i>, every <i>Woman</i> may infallibly know
an approaching or instant <i>MISCARRIAGE</i>, either in
<i>herself</i> or <i>another</i>: As also to set forth, by what <i>PROGNOSTICK
SIGNS</i>, she may know the <i>Danger</i> she is
threatned with upon that Occasion.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> Undertaking, I hope, may prove <i>conducive</i>
to the Welfare of that tender <span class='sc'>Sex</span>; it being too
common for <i>Women</i> to neglect the <i>proper Means</i>, through
a supine <i>Ignorance</i> of the <i>Nature</i>, and <i>Danger</i> of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span><i>CONDITION</i>. But This, however, is generally owing
to indiscreet <span class='sc'>Old Women</span> about them; (as I have often
observ’d, and oft’ner had Occasion to hear) who
either keep the <i>PATIENT</i> in <i>Suspence</i>, wheedling and
telling her idle Stories, that the <span class='sc'>Case</span> is not so <i>dangerous</i>,
the <i>Pains</i>, <i>Floodings</i>, &amp;c. will go off in good Time,
and the like: Or afterwards (upon appearance of more
severe growing <span class='sc'>Symptoms</span>) they extenuate the <i>Danger</i>,
telling her to submit with <i>Patience</i>, the common <span class='sc'>Misfortune</span>
cannot possibly be prevented, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>TO</em> which usual <i>Suggestions</i>, I answer; that as the
<i>one</i> is an ignorant and imprudent <i>Insinuation</i>, the <i>other</i> is
a downright <i>Falsity</i>: For in the <i>first CASE</i>, the <i>Woman</i>
is diverted by foolish <i>Hopes</i> from applying for proper
<span class='sc'>Advice</span>, until perhaps it is past all <span class='sc'>Remedy</span>; and in
the <i>second</i>, she is misled very often to her utter <i>RUIN</i>:
Since whatever hath not yet <i>happen’d</i>, may peradventure
be happily <i>prevented</i>; and even upon the <i>last Extremity</i>
of the most <i>violent Occasion</i>, the <i>Severity</i> of the <span class='sc'>Case</span> may
possibly be averted by good Management, and the <i>Danger</i>
entirely compounded for by proper Conduct.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em>, I cannot but think, it is worth
any <i>Woman</i>’s while to know the <span class='sc'>Marks</span> of an <i>approaching</i>
and <i>instant ABORTION</i>: Whereof the <i>DIAGNOSTICKS</i>
are as follow, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>I. A sudden <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Extenuation</span></em> and <i>Falling</i> of the

if the <i>right</i> <span class='sc'>Breast</span> falls, is a <span class='sc'>Male</span>; but if the <i>left</i>, a

<p class='c005'>II. A <span class='sc'>Watery Milk</span> flows<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c017'><sup>[102]</sup></a> in Abundance from
those <i>FALLEN BREASTS</i>, discovering the future
Danger.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>III. <em class='gesperrt'>PALPITATIONS</em> of the <i>Heart</i>, frequently accompany’d
with a <i>Coarctation</i> of the <i>Sides</i> and <i>Upper
Belly</i>, very much incommoding the <span class='sc'>Patient</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. A <i>GRAVITY</i> or <i>Heaviness</i> of the <i>Loins</i>, and
<i>Thighs</i>; <i>Gnawing</i> of the <i>Stomach</i>, <i>Pains</i> of the <i>Head</i> and
<i>Eyes</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. A <i>TREMOR</i>, or <i>Trembling</i> and <i>Quaking FITS</i>,
attended with a <i>Frigidity</i> of the exteriour <i>Limbs</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. A <i>Rigor</i> and Stiffness, or a <i>Vibration</i> and Concussion
of the <i>SKIN</i> and <i>MUSCLES</i> of the whole Body,
with a concomitant <i>Chilness</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. <em class='gesperrt'>HORROUR</em>, <i>Fevers</i>, <i>Faintings</i>, <i>Swoonings</i>, and
sometimes <i>Convulsions</i>, <i>Cramps</i>, &amp;c. all foreboding the
coming <i>Malady</i>. These are the usual and principal
Marks of an <i>approaching ABORTION</i>: Which when
<i>Instant</i>, and the <i>Time</i> at Hand, then the</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII<sup>th</sup> <i>DIAGNOSTICK</i> plainly appears; which is a
<i>corrupt WATER</i> flowing <i>first</i>, next a <i>bloody WATER</i>,
then <i>pure</i> <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, after that small <i>Clods</i> of <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, and
at length, the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> itself (<i>form’d</i> or <i>inform’d</i>) follows
of Course.</p>

<p class='c006'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> I proceed to the usual <i>Prognosticks</i> of
<i>ABORTION</i>; which take as follow in their proper
Order, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> <i>Women</i> are more endanger’d in a <span class='sc'>Miscarriage</span>,
than in a <i>Natural Birth</i>: because <span class='sc'>That</span> happening
at a <i>preternatural Time</i>, is of greater <i>Violence</i> than <span class='sc'>This</span>.
For like as <i>ripe Fruit</i>, whose <i>Stalk</i> is so loose in its
Season from the <i>Tree</i>, that the <i>Fruit</i> falls of its own
Accord: So it is in a <i>Natural Birth</i>, for the <i>Vessels</i> and
<i>Ligaments</i>, by which the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> adheres to the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
easily loose and break spontaneously; which in an
Abortion, must needs happen by a more dangerous
painful <i>Force</i> and <i>Violence</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THO’</em> <i>Women</i> (in this <i>Case</i>) may frequently
escape with their <i>Lives</i>, yet their <i>Natural Constitution</i> is
thereby too often broke at least, and debilitated, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>thereupon subjected to one or other heavy <i>SYMPTOM</i>
or <i>DISEASE</i>; if not also rendred quite <i>BARREN</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> sometimes, because of the <i>Pains</i>, <i>Flux</i>, or
<i>Putrefaction</i> of the retain’d <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, <i>Fevers</i>, and other
<i>Distempers</i> generally ensue: Sometimes by the violent
<i>Disruption</i> of the <i>Vessels</i>, great <i>Floodings</i> and Loss of
<span class='sc'>Blood</span> happen; upon which <i>Faintings</i>, <i>Swoonings</i>, <i>Convulsions</i>,
and at length <span class='sc'>Death</span> it self follows: But, in
fine, <i>Convulsions</i> happening<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c017'><sup>[103]</sup></a> either <i>at the Time</i>, or <i>after
ABORTION</i>, the <i>Case</i> is most <i>dangerous</i>; for then the
<span class='sc'>Patient</span> seldom escapes.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>first MISCARRIAGE</i> is most <i>dangerous</i> to
all; because the <i>Genital Parts</i> are more streight or constricted,
and less acquainted with such severe distending
<i>Pains</i>: And besides the <span class='sc'>Orifices</span> of the <i>Vessels</i> being
so violently dilacerated, the <i>Party</i> often continues afterwards
<i>Sterile</i> or <i>Barren</i> the rest of her Life<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c017'><sup>[104]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>LEAN</em> and <i>tender Women</i> are much endanger’d
in <i>ABORTION</i>, by Reason of their <i>Debility</i> and <i>Infirmity</i>:
As Women too fat are, on the other Hand; because
of the great <i>Astriction</i> and <i>Narrowness</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Passages</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>younger</i> the <span class='sc'>Abortive</span> <i>Production</i> happens
to be, the less the <i>Woman</i> is endanger’d; because the
<i>larger</i> the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> is, it gives the greater <i>Pains</i> and <i>Ruption</i>
of the <i>Vessels</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>WHATEVER</em> happens in the 7th or 9th
<i>Month</i>, may be reckon’d a <i>safe BIRTH</i>, provided the
<i>Child</i> be <span class='sc'>Alive</span>: Whereas if <span class='sc'>Dead</span>, it is extremely dangerous.
But above <i>All</i>, the <i>Eighth</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Month</span></em> is to be
most <i>dreaded</i>, not only because of the <i>Largeness</i> of the
<i>INFANT</i>, but also because of the <i>pernicious Quality</i> of
<i>that</i> <span class='sc'>Month</span>; as will hereafter more amply appear in
Chap. 34.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> Consideration leads me farther to observe;
That, from the Beginning of the <i>5th</i>, until the
Middle of the <i>6th</i> <i>Month</i>, the <i>INFANT</i> is least liable
to <i>Danger</i><a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c017'><sup>[105]</sup></a>: So next in the <i>4th</i>, and from the Middle
of the <i>6th</i>, until the Close of the 7<i>th Month</i>: Then of
course it is <i>safer</i> in the <i>3d</i> and <i>2d</i> <i>Months</i>, than in the
<i>1st</i> or <i>9th</i>. For the least <i>Cause</i> may expell the <span class='sc'>Embryo</span>
in the <i>First</i>, and break the <i>Mature Ligaments</i> of the
<i>INFANT</i> in the <i>Ninth</i>. But of all the whole Time,
as I said before, the <i>8th</i> <i>Month</i> is the <i>most</i><a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c017'><sup>[106]</sup></a> <i>dangerous</i>,
both to <em class='gesperrt'><i>MOTHER</i></em> and <em class='gesperrt'><i>INFANT</i></em>: according to
which Consideration and Order of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Time</span></em>, the prudent
<i>Physician</i> may, with more or less either <i>Fear</i> on
the <i>one hand</i>, or <i>Assurance</i> on the <i>other</i>, exhibit or prescribe
proper <i>REMEDIES</i> for the <i>Preservation</i> or <i>Recovery</i>
of his <span class='sc'>Patients</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> whence I come in the next place to offer
my serious <i>Sentiments</i> upon the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Cure</span></em> of this <i>Malady</i>,
and the <i>Prevention</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><i>ABORTION</i></em>: Which difficult
<i>Work</i> depends chiefly upon the <i>Preservation</i> of both <i>MOTHER</i>
and <i>INFANT</i>; for when the <span class='sc'>Miscarriage</span> is
once over, the <span class='sc'>Cure</span> then does not much differ from
the <i>Case</i> of a <i>natural BIRTH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> in all <i>Cases</i> of this nature, it is an
infallible <i>Maxim</i>, that it is more easy to prevent <span class='sc'>Miscarriage</span>,
than to relieve or rectify the <i>Miscarrying Woman</i>;
and more proper to begin that <i>Prevention</i> <span class='sc'>Before</span>,
than <span class='sc'>After</span> <i>Conception</i>: Because the most proper <i>Remedies</i>
for obviating many <i>Causes</i> of <i>ABORTION</i>, cannot
so well be adhibited to the <i>Woman</i> after she is <span class='sc'>Pregnant</span>.
And besides, as <i>those Causes</i> are very <i>Different</i>
and various (as more fully appears from what has been
said); so the Manner and Method of <i>Prevention</i> cannot
be altogether exactly <i>Uniform</i>; every <i>Cause</i> requiring
its respective <span class='sc'>Cure</span>, before a <i>Prevention</i> can be effected.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em>, in my humble Opinion, the
<i>first Step</i> towards this <i>Prevention</i> is to weigh well and
consider carefully the <i>CONSTITUTION</i> of the yet
<i>unimpregnated Woman</i>; in order to know and discover the
<i>Cause</i> or <i>Causes</i> either of <span class='sc'>Body</span>, or <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, which may
or can occasion any future <i>ABORTION</i>. Now in this
<span class='sc'>Case</span>, <i>Women</i> having once <i>miscarry’d</i>, or oftner, methinks
they may easily find out the <span class='sc'>Cause</span> <i>Themselves</i>,
by the Help of their <i>Midwives</i>; which being done,
they should endeavour to have it remov’d, and effectually
<i>cur’d</i>, before they <i>conceive</i> any more. However, if
it chance to be neglected at that time, it may be more
prudently undertaken afterwards, with such <i>Precaution</i>,
as the <i>Nature</i> of the <i>CAUSE</i> and <i>CONSTITUTION</i> of
the <i>Woman</i> require: Always remembring, but especially
<i>before</i> or <i>about</i> the usual <i>Time</i> of <i>ABORTION</i>, to
make use of proper <i>Corroboratives</i> for strengthening both
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em></i> and <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>; since <i>Women</i>, <i>miscarrying</i>
from any one internal <i>Cause</i>, commonly bear their
<i>Conceptions</i> to a certain <span class='sc'>Time</span>, which they cannot exceed,
unless that <i>Cause</i> be judiciously removed beforehand.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>I ONCE</em> had an accidental Opportunity of being
fully satisfied of the Veracity of this <span class='sc'>Case</span>, in a <i>Woman</i>
of good Note in the City of <i>Dresden</i>; who <i>miscarried
fourteen Times</i> in less than <i>eight Years</i>; being never
able to <i>go</i> beyond the <i>tenth Day</i> of the <i>fourth Month</i>,
and commonly losing the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span> about the <i>last</i> of the
<i>Third</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AT</em> my Arrival in that <i>Place</i>, I found my <i>Credit</i>, for
my necessary <i>Supplies</i>, upon a certain <span class='sc'>Merchant</span>; who
(with great Concern) gave me this melancholick Account
of his <span class='sc'>Spouse</span>, desiring my good <i>Offices</i>, if possibly
any Means could be of Service. Upon which, I
first made it my Business to discover, <i>that internal Cause</i>,
wherein <i>she</i>, and her ordinary <i>Midwives</i>, had been so
often mistaken; this being done, I happily performed
the <span class='sc'>Cure</span>, tho’ (as a <i>Traveller</i>) I had not the Satisfaction
of staying there to see the <i>Consequence</i>. But, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>by my last Advices from the grateful <i>Husband</i>, I
find <i>she</i> is now <span class='sc'>Mother</span> of two pretty <i>Boys</i> and a
fine <i>Girl</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> of <span class='sc'>Abortion</span> then being duly and discreetly
<i>first</i> discovered, if it proceeds from any <i>Intemperature</i>
either of the <span class='sc'>Body</span> or the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; the <i>same</i> may
be prevented chiefly by introducing the <i>contrary Temperament</i>,
according to <i>Hippocrates</i>’s<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c017'><sup>[107]</sup></a> Judgment, that
<i>Contraries are the</i> <span class='sc'>Remedies</span> <i>of Contraries</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> it proceeds from too much <span class='sc'>Fatness</span>, her <i>Body</i> is
to be reduced; if it comes from too much <span class='sc'>Leanness</span>, a
convenient <i>Diet</i> and good <i>Regimen</i>, &amp;c. will help to restore
her.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> it happens from a <i>PLETHORY</i>, the too much
abounding <i>BLOOD</i> is to be circumspectly lessened: As
the Humours are to be judiciously evacuated, if it arises
from a <i>Cacochymy</i>; and all Causes affecting the
Spirits and Humours are to be carefully removed and
avoided.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>DISEASES</em> of the whole <i>Body</i> are to be prevented
as much as possible, by a <i>Regularity</i> of proper <i>DIET</i>
and <i>REGIMEN</i> of Health; but whenever <i>These</i> are
incident, they ought to be cured, as the <i>Nature</i> of the
<i>DISEASE</i> and <i>CONSTITUTION</i> of the <i>Woman</i> will
prudentially permit.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> <i>ABORTION</i> happens from any <i>Cause</i> on the part
of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, <i>that</i> must absolutely be removed before
<i>CONCEPTION</i>, and resisted afterwards during the
<i>FOETURA</i>, by the discreet <i>Use</i> of proper Means.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> it arises from any <i>Cause</i> of the <i>Neighbouring Parts</i>,
that is to be carefully managed or avoided, and <i>prevented</i>
more easily than <i>cured</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the <i>Causes</i> on the Part of the <i>INFANT</i>, I
shall refer the <i><em class='gesperrt'>READER</em></i> to the preceding <i>Chapter</i>
only; as I do likewise if it comes from any <i>SYMPTOM</i>
of the <i>Months</i>, or from any <i>Acute Disease</i>, to their
respective <i>Chapters</i> in this <i>SECTION</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span><em class='gesperrt'>FINALLY</em>, If it proceeds from any <i>Procatarctick
CAUSES</i>, either <i>internal</i> or <i>external</i>, all such are to be
sedulously avoided and prevented; but whenever <i>These</i>
happen, they are generally <i>cured</i> by proper <i>ALTERATIVES</i>
of an <i>Astringent Quality</i>, for confirming the <i>Ligaments</i>;
and <i>CORROBORATIVES</i> for comforting the
<i>INFANT</i>, and cherishing the <i>WOMB</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> supposing, at last, the <i>Case</i> desperate, and
past all <span class='sc'>Remedy</span>, through <i>Negligence</i> or <i>Delay</i>, that the
<span class='sc'>Cure</span> cannot possibly be effected, nor the <i>Misfortune</i> of
<i>Instant</i> <span class='sc'>Abortion</span> prevented; why then the <i>Woman</i>
ought to be carefully comforted and strengthened, the
<i>Ligaments</i> relaxed, the <i>Passages</i> dilated, and the <i>expulsive
Faculty</i> assisted; so that the worse <i>Consequences</i> and greater
<i>Danger</i> may be averted.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> having now, in fine, thus at large treated
upon the Subject of <span class='sc'>Abortion</span>, it leads me methodically
(of Course) to touch upon all other <span class='sc'>Births</span> respecting
<i>Time</i>; I mean <i>Legitimate</i> and <i>Illegitimate</i> <span class='sc'>Births</span>:
Which (however) I shall discuss in as <i>Succinct Terms</i> as
I can, to oblige the <span class='sc'>Reader</span>. And <i>first</i>,</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXXI.</span><br /> <i>Of a <em class='gesperrt'>LEGITIMATE BIRTH</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>A <i>Legitimate</i> <i>BIRTH</i> respects <span class='sc'>Time</span> only, and that
is properly so called, which most frequently happens,
according to the <i>Common Law</i> of <span class='sc'>Nature</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is never sufficiently to be admired as <i>Wonderful</i>,
that <span class='sc'>Man</span>, who is born <i>HEREDITARY LORD</i> of the
<i>Universe</i>, and invested with <i>SUPREME DOMINION</i>
over all <i>Creatures</i>, should, however yet, be the only one
deprived of some certain <i>definite Time</i> for his <i>BIRTH</i><a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c017'><sup>[108]</sup></a>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>it happening often in the <i>seventh</i>, commonly in the <i>ninth</i>
and <i>tenth</i>, and sometimes in the <i>eighth</i> and <i>eleventh Months</i>,
and <i>That</i> also at all Times of the Year: Whereas, on
the other hand, all the rest of <i>inferiour Creatures</i> have
their certain <i>prefixed Times</i>, both of <i>carrying</i> their
<i>YOUNG</i>, and <i>bringing them forth</i>, beyond which they
cannot go, nor controul the Order of <i>NATURE</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, this being the <i>Good Work</i> and <i>Will</i>
of the Great <i>CREATOR</i>, deserves more our silent <i>Wonder</i>
and <i>Admiration</i>, than our bold <i>Enquiry</i>, or curious
<i>Scrutiny</i>, into the <i>REASON</i> of it.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> notwithstanding, I hope, we may easily account
for the <i>Latitude</i> of <i>TIME</i> allowed our <i>Births</i>,
when we consider what has been said of the Times of
<i>Formation</i> and <i>Animation</i> in their proper Places<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c017'><sup>[109]</sup></a>. If
then these require a proportionable <i>Latitude</i>, what wonder
is it that the <i>Legitimate Time</i> of Birth is of such
<i>Extent</i>? Not that I mean that the <i>rational Soul</i> is introduced
either at different Times, or by Piece-meals, only
that it is not <i>done</i> this or that Day <i>precisely</i>. And
farther (according to <i>AVERROES</i>, that great <i>Commentator</i>)
<i>Man</i><a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c017'><sup>[110]</sup></a>, not only in the Womb, but also after Birth,
even until his <i>Juvenile Age</i>, is but <i>a-generating</i>; and
from that Time to old Age he begins to <i>decline</i>: yet
we daily see that <i>this Change</i> is not equal to all, in that
some Men do but arrive to their most robust and <i>vigorous
State</i> about the fortieth Year of their Age, whereas
others come to that Length about the thirtieth, and
most about the thirty-fifth.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> it is an <i>Auspicious Crisis</i> which happens any Time
of the <i>Critical Day</i>, whether anticipated or postponed
by a few Hours: And as the <i>Fruit</i> of <i>Trees</i> have their
constituted Time of <i>Maturity</i>, which notwithstanding
some are perfected sooner, and some later; so (I think)
it may be also in the present Case of <i>Births</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet, to go a little further, without
Offence: As to the <i>Legitimacy</i> of <i>BIRTHS</i>, I don’t
see any Reason why every <i>Birth</i>, producing a <i>vital
Child</i>, may not be justly esteemed timely <i>lawful</i>, whether
it be of the <i>seventh</i>, <i>eighth</i>, <i>ninth</i>, <i>tenth</i>, or <i>eleventh
Month</i>: But because few of our antient and learned
<i>Predecessors</i> have been inclined to admit any standing
<i>RULE</i> of such a large <i>Extent</i>, in this <i>CASE</i> we shall be
far from desiring to establish any <i>New One</i>, or advance
any <i>Paradox</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>I SHALL</em> therefore (in this Place) only touch
upon <i>That</i> which most <i>Authors</i> seem to have agreed upon,
and reckon the most common <i>Legitimate Birth</i>;
namely, which happens (at the soonest) about the <i>260th</i>
<i>Day</i> from <i>CONCEPTION</i>, being the <i>first</i> of the <i>38th</i>
<i>Week</i>, or the <i>20th</i> of the <i>ninth Month</i>; as it doth also
sometimes fall out (<i>ten Days later</i>) about the <i>270th</i>,
when it is neither <i>too soon</i>, nor <i>too late</i>; and which likewise
(at the latest) happens before the <i>280th</i> <i>Day</i>;
that is, the <i>last</i> of the <i>40th</i> <i>Week</i>, or the <i>10th</i> <i>Day</i> of
the <i>10th</i> <i>Month</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> <i>This</i> (if I may be permitted to speak my
Mind) depends much upon the <i>Time of Conception</i>; it
being my Opinion, that if the Woman did conceive
when <i>recently purged</i>, I mean shortly after the natural
Flux, she may <i>bring forth</i> in the beginning<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c017'><sup>[111]</sup></a> of the
<i>9th</i> <i>Month</i>; whereas, if when the <i>Menstrua</i> were almost
ready to <i>flow</i>, towards <i>its Close</i>, or later: And if in the
<i>Interval</i> betwixt these Times, she may <i>produce her Child</i>
in the <i>middle</i> of the Month: Because as <i>Plants</i> or <i>Corn</i>
arrive much sooner to <i>Maturity</i> after the <i>New</i> than after
the <i>Full-Moon</i>, so it may be also with the <i>Fœtus</i>, because
of the more or less <i>Vigour</i> of the <i>Womb</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, in short, it is to be observed, that
in all these <i>Cases</i>, we may commonly allow a few <i>more
Days</i> for the <em class='gesperrt'><i>GIRL</i></em> than the <em class='gesperrt'><i>BOY</i></em>, as appears from
<i>Sect.</i> I. <i>Chap.</i> 9.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em>, in fine, according to the Opinion of the
most Learned and Curious <i>Practisers</i> in <i>MIDWIFERY</i>,
this <i>BIRTH</i> happens always<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c017'><sup>[112]</sup></a> at the <i>self-same Hour</i> of the
<i>Day</i> or <i>Night</i>, in which the <i>Woman</i> <span class='sc'>Conceiv’d</span>: So
that from hence it is, that most <i>BIRTHS</i> happen in the
<i>Night</i>, or Dawning of the <i>Day</i>; wherefore they All
agree, that a <i>Legitimate BIRTH</i> requires not only a certain
definite Number of <i>Days</i>, but also of <i>Hours</i>, &amp;c.

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> an <i>Illegitimate BIRTH</i> also respects <i>TIME</i>, so
<i>That</i> is only to be call’d so, which happens <i>before</i>
or <i>after</i> the <i>TIME</i> instituted by the <i>Law</i> of <i>Nature</i>.
Hence all unhappy <i>ABORTIONS</i> belong to this <i>Head</i>;
which being largely handled (apart) in the <i>Chapter</i> just
aforegoing, I shall only here cursorily touch upon <i>That</i>,
which (in a distinct sense) is accounted an <i>Illegitimate
BIRTH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> I may the better define <i>This Sort</i> of <i>BIRTH</i>,
I shall <i>first</i> observe, that <i>Nature</i> has instituted Nothing
<i>rashly</i>, nor in <i>vain</i>, neither does it ever act by <span class='sc'>Chance</span>.
<i>She</i> having then limited a certain <span class='sc'>Time</span> (however at
large) within which all <i>Legitimate BIRTHS</i> happen, and
all <i>vital Children</i> are born; of consequence, whatever
happens <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> that <i>Time</i>, is an <i>Illegitimate

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXXIII.</span><br /> <i>Of a Seven-Months <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>TO</em> prove the <span class='sc'>Legitimacy</span> of this <i>BIRTH</i>, and the
<i>Possibility</i> of this <i>Month</i>’s producing a <i>vital Child</i>,
I need not confine myself to the <i>Judgments</i> of the most
Wise and Divine <i>Hippocrates</i>, <i>Galen</i>, and <i>others</i>, nor to
the <i>Principles</i> of <span class='sc'>Physick</span> in particular: but may justly
appeal to All the rest of the <i>Liberal Arts</i> and <i>Sciences</i>,
which (as far as I am duly acquainted with them) generally
agree in <i>Defence</i> of This Position.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is (however) certain, that the <span class='sc'>Child</span> born <i>before</i>
the <i>Twentieth Day</i> of this <i>Month</i> is commonly <i>weak</i> and
<i>infirm</i>. And for that Reason the <i>later</i> the <i>BIRTH</i> happens
in the <i>Month</i>, the more <i>brisk</i> and <i>lively</i> is the
<span class='sc'>Child</span>: As I have more than once observ’d, that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span><i>Latter Part</i> (about the <i>210th</i> <i>Day</i> from <i>CONCEPTION</i>)
hath produced as sprightly vivacious <i>Children</i> as any at
All. Wherefore, in short, I cannot help having full as
good an Opinion of such a <span class='sc'>Child</span> born about the <i>last</i>
of the <i>SEVENTH</i>, as of any such born in the beginning
of the <i>Ninth Month</i>, provided it be not expell’d by
some <i>preternatural Cause</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>TO</em> examine this nice Matter a little more clearly,
let us inspect into the <i>Nature</i> and <i>Quality</i> of the
<em class='gesperrt'>Month</em>: In order to which, I hope, we may rationally
observe,</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> (according to the best <i>Astrologers</i>) the
latter of the <span class='sc'>Planets</span>, (the <i>Moon</i>) influentially presides
over the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> in this <i>Month</i>; whose frigid and humid
<i>Qualitys</i> are thought to afford the several <i>Parts</i> of it a certain
<i>Fatness</i>, thereby relaxing and easily distending the
<span class='sc'>Matrix</span>: Which being done, and the <span class='sc'>Child</span> now perfected
by the whole Body of the <span class='sc'>Planets</span>, that have <i>All</i>
particularly (in their order) duly discharg’d their respective
<i>Functions</i> towards its Perfection; provided it has
a Competency of <i>Strength</i> and <i>Vigour</i>, it forwardly appears
about the Close of this <i>Month</i> with great <i>Ease</i> and <i>Facility</i>,
and may continue both <i>Healthy</i> and <i>Lively</i> after its
<i>Birth</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> is universally acknowledged to be a <i>perfect</i>
and <i>compleat</i> <span class='sc'>Number</span>; from whence <i>Cicero</i> calls it
<i>NODUS OMNIUM</i>, or the <i>Knot of all Things</i>. As the
Wise <i>Pythagoreans</i> justly term it otherwise the <i>Vehicle of
Man’s Life</i>: Not only because that, according to the
<i>Violence</i> of any <span class='sc'>Disease</span>, and the <i>Strength</i> of the <span class='sc'>Patient</span>,
a <i>CRISIS</i> happens either in the <i>Seventh</i>, or the <i>multiply’d
Seventh Day</i>; but also because, as <span class='sc'>Conception</span> is certain
upon <i>Seven-Hours Retention</i>; and the Work of <i>Coagulation</i>
perfected in <i>Seven Days</i>, so may That of full <i>Maturity</i>
be in <i>Seven Months</i>, and accordingly this <i>MONTH</i> may
very reasonably produce <i>vital Children</i>. But by the way,</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> fictitious such things as savour of
<i>Astrology</i>, may be reckon’d by <i>Some</i>, yet who knows not
that the <i>Seventh Hour</i>, and <i>Seventh Day</i> after its <i>BIRTH</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>determines the <span class='sc'>Child</span> either to <i>Life</i> or <i>Death</i>? Who
does not well know, That in the <i>Seventh Month</i>, its
<span class='sc'>Teeth</span> begin to break out and appear? That in the
<i>Seventh Year</i> (according to <i>Plutarch</i>) it changes its
<span class='sc'>Teeth</span>? Who does not find, That<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c017'><sup>[115]</sup></a> the <i>Age of Man</i>
depends upon <i>SEPTENARY Mutations</i>? That the <i>First
Seven Years</i> conclude his <span class='sc'>Infancy</span>; as the <i>Second</i> finish
his <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pueritia</span></span>, or <i>Childhood</i>; and the <i>Third</i> compleat his
<span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adolescentia</span></span>, or <i>Youthful Growing Age</i>? To which
his <span class='sc'>Juventus</span>, or more vigorous <i>Youthfulness</i>, succeeds;
which is absolv’d in <i>twice Seven Years</i> more: For in <i>This
Juvenile</i> Age, the <i>Body</i> attains to its full <span class='sc'>Stature</span>; as
the <i>Bones</i>, <i>Membranes</i>, and <i>Fibres</i> arrive to their due Solidity.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> again is succeeded by the <i>Fifth</i>, call’d <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Virilitas</span></span>,
the <i>Virile</i> or <i>Manly Age</i>; consisting of <i>twice Seven
Years</i> more, being in all <i>Seven times Seven Years</i>: In
which <span class='sc'>Manhood</span>, the <i>Facultys</i> of the <span class='sc'>Mind</span>, as well as
the <i>Strength</i> of the <span class='sc'>Body</span>, are most resplendent and perfect;
tho’ in almost All <i>Women</i>, the <i>Generative Power</i>
begins to cease at this <span class='sc'>Age</span>, as their <span class='sc'>Terms</span> commonly
do, however, not without a great <i>Disorder</i> of the Motion
of the <span class='sc'>Blood</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Sixth Age</i> of Man, or the <span class='sc'>Senectus</span>, is compos’d
of <i>twice Seven Years</i> more, and extends itself to
<i>Sixty Three</i>: In <i>This Old Age</i> the <i>Natural VIGOUR</i> very
much declines, the <i>BODY</i> waxes both <i>dry</i> and <i>lean</i>, the
<i>MEMORY</i> begins to fail, and the <i>PERSON</i> grows more
<i>Anxious</i>, <i>Careful</i> and <i>Covetous</i>. As in the <i>Seventh</i> and
<i>Last Age</i>, (or <span class='sc'>Dotage</span>, as it were) he becomes <i>Feeble</i>
and <i>Decrepit</i>; which generally consists of <i>Seven Years</i>
more. So that, in fine, according to this very rational
and plausible <i>Computation</i>, of the Learned and most Ingenious
Dr. <i>Sprengell</i>, the <span class='sc'>Age</span> and <span class='sc'>Life</span> of <span class='sc'>Man</span> is
commonly reckon’d to amount to <i>Seven times Ten Years</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is also farther observable, that as the <span class='sc'>Soul</span> of
Man has <i>seven</i> different <i>Appellations</i>, according to its seven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>principal <i>Offices</i>, (as amply appears by <i>Sect.</i> I. <i>Chap.</i> 4.)
so there are <i>SEVEN Degrees</i> in the <span class='sc'>Body</span>, to compleat
its <i>Dimensions</i>; viz. <i>Marrow</i>, <i>Bone</i>, <i>Nerve</i>, <i>Vein</i>, <i>Artery</i>,
<i>Flesh</i>, and <i>Skin</i>: As there are also <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEVEN</em></i> in
Number, which (according to <i>Macrobius</i>) the <i>Greeks</i>
call <i>BLACK MEMBERS</i>; viz. the <i>Tongue</i>, <i>Heart</i>,
<i>Lungs</i>, <i>Liver</i>, <i>Spleen</i>, and <i>Two Kidneys</i>, to consummate the
<i>Compositum</i>. Yea, <i>Hippocrates</i><a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c017'><sup>[116]</sup></a> himself confirms the <i>Efficacy</i>
and <i>Præstancy</i>, <i>Fulness</i> and <i>Perfection</i> of this Number.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have also remarkably observ’d, that the Number
<i>Seven</i> is most powerful and signally predominant in <i>Cœlestials</i>;
as the <i>Seven Circles</i> in the <span class='sc'>Heavens</span>, according
to the <i>Longitude of the Axle-Tree</i>: The <i>Seven Stars</i> about
the <i>Artick-Pole</i>, called <span class='sc'>Charles’s-Wain</span>: The <i>Seven
Stars</i> also call’d <span class='sc'>Pleiades</span>: The <i>Seven Planets</i>, giving
Names to the <i>Seven Days of the</i> <span class='sc'>Week</span>: The <i>Periodical
Revolution</i> of the <span class='sc'>Moon</span> every <i>Seventh Day</i>, running
round the Compass of the whole <span class='sc'>Zodiack</span> in <i>Four Times
Seven Days</i>; that is, considering her <i>Phases</i> as obverted
to the <span class='sc'>Sun</span>. And <i>Linus</i>, a most ancient celebrated Poet,
sings thus:</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Number</i> seems likewise to be of the greatest
Esteem in <i>Religion</i>; and from hence among the <i>Hebrews</i>,
to swear, is call’d <i>SEPTENARE</i><a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c017'><sup>[117]</sup></a>, (that is, to <i>protest</i> by
<i>Seven</i>:) So <i>Abraham</i> making the <span class='sc'>Covenant</span> with <i>Abimelech</i>,
appointed <i>Seven Ewe-Lambs</i> for a Testimony: The
<i>Seventh Day</i> the Great <i>CREATOR</i> rested from his
Work: <i>Jacob</i> served <i>Seven Years</i>: <i>Seven Days</i> the People
bewail’d the Death of <i>Jacob</i>: <i>Elisha</i> (the Prophet) said

<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>self <i>Seven Times</i> in <i>Jordan</i>, and thou shalt be made
whole, and thy Flesh become clean: And, in fine, <i>David</i>
said, <i>Seven Times</i> a day do I praise <i>THEE</i>, because
of thy righteous Judgments.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em>, and innumerable such like <i>Sentences</i> are
not only couch’d in the <i>Books</i> of <i>Moses</i>, and the whole
<i>Volume</i> of the <i>Old Testament</i>; but also expresly contain’d
in the <span class='sc'>Gospel</span>, and interspers’d through the whole
<i>Bulk</i> of the <i>New</i>: As the <i>Seven Beatitudes</i>, the <i>Seven
Virtues</i>, the <i>Seven Vices</i>, the <i>Seven Petitions</i> of the
<i>LORD’s PRAYER</i>, the <i>Seven Words</i> of our <i>SAVIOUR</i>
upon the <i>Cross</i>, &amp;c. But besides, in the <i>Apocalypse</i> or
<i>Revelation</i> of St. <i>JOHN</i>, this mysterious <i>NUMBER</i> is
most frequently mention’d, to denote its <i>Efficacy</i> and
<i>Excellency</i> of representing some <i>Ænigmatical</i> Truth or
Emblem.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, the <i>Divine Apostle</i> signifies and
sets forth there, the <i>Persecution</i> of the <i>CHURCH</i> (under
the Tyrants, <i>Domitian</i>, <i>Trajan</i>, &amp;c. which began in the
<i>Primitive CHURCH</i> in his own Days, and continued
for three hundred Years, even to the Reign of <i>Constantine</i>
the Great) by the <i>Allegory</i> of<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c017'><sup>[118]</sup></a><i>SEVEN SEALS</i>.
He figures out the <i>Heresys</i> of the <i>ARIANS</i>, &amp;c. (from
the Time of <i>Constantine</i> to the Reign of <i>Theodosius</i>, being
three hundred Years more) by that of<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c017'><sup>[119]</sup></a><i>SEVEN

the future <i>Plagues</i> of <i>ANTI-CHRIST</i> (from the Time of
<i>Pope Bonifacius</i>, to these our present Days) by<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c017'><sup>[120]</sup></a><i>SEVEN

Learned Divine, <i>Peter Palladius</i> Bishop of <i>Rochel</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I say, with Submission to wiser Heads, that <i>These</i>
and the whole Train of those Sacred <i>Allegorical Allusions</i>
used in this <i>Book</i>, might have been as pertinently
express’d by any <i>other Number</i>, as the <i>SEPTENARY</i>;
were it not that, this <i>Number</i> better implies a certain
<i>FULNESS</i> of <i>Sacred Mysterys</i>: As I think that <i>Number</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>likewise (in all rational probability) may properly portend
here, <i>PERFECTION</i> in <i>Maturity</i>, and <i>COMPLETION</i>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXXIV.</span><br /> <i>Of an Eight-Months <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to this Point, the <i>Case</i> indeed differs much in
my Judgment from the <i>Former</i>: For tho’ I have
heard some loquacious <i>Women</i> strenuously aver the <i>contrary</i>,
because of their own rash <i>Mistakes</i>; yet I cannot
help being of the same Opinion still, that this
<span class='sc'>Month</span> seldom or never produces a <i>living</i>, or <i>lively</i>
<span class='sc'>Child</span>: And that because, if the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> hath <i>Strength</i>
enough, it must needs appear about the <i>Close</i> of the
<i>Seventh Month</i>; but if not, the <i>Attempts</i> are the same,
according to its greater or less <i>Abilitys</i>; (as most <span class='sc'>Mothers</span>
may very sensibly observe in their own Conditions,
by its extraordinary <i>Motions</i> and Struggles at that
<i>Time</i>) whereby it is so <i>weaken’d</i> and <i>debilitated</i>, that it
requires the <i>Eighth full Month</i>, and Part of the <i>Ninth</i>,
to recover itself, and recollect its <i>exhausted Strength</i> and
<i>Vigour</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ANOTHER</em> Natural <i>Reason</i> besides may be given
for <i>This</i>; because that this <span class='sc'>Month</span> is peculiar to the
<i>Planet</i> <span class='sc'>Saturn</span>, which is an Enemy to all <i>Creatures</i> that
breath <span class='sc'>Life</span>: For he now returns not with the same
<i>Meekness</i> and <i>Lenity</i> of Influence that he used in the <i>First
Month</i> of the <i>CONCEPTION</i>, but with a far greater <i>Severity</i>
of Tyranny and Enmity; as by his <i>Frigidity</i>, lessening
and extinguishing the <i>Native Heat</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>,
rendering it Unactive and Slow to <i>Motion</i>; so by his
<i>Siccity</i>, constringing the <i>Passages</i> and <i>Orifice</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>: which, if so, must (of necessity) very much
endanger both the <i>MOTHER</i> and the <i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span><em class='gesperrt'>BE</em> this as it will, yet it is most certain, that the
<span class='sc'>Child</span> born in this <span class='sc'>Month</span> is always very <i>Weak</i> and
<i>Sickly</i>; However if, by chance, it survives the <i>14th</i>, it
may live till about the <i>40th Day</i>, when it most commonly
<i>breathes its Last</i>: Yet if it also survives this
<i>Time</i>, the greatest <i>Danger</i> being then over, it may, by
the means of tender <span class='sc'>Care</span> and <span class='sc'>Art</span>, be brought up as
<i>others</i> are usually reared: But how <i>long-liv’d</i> soever, or
well-governed its <i>Health</i> may be, it will still continue
of a <i>weakly</i> and <i>tender Constitution</i> of Body, if not also
half-witted<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c017'><sup>[121]</sup></a> in Mind.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> this <i>Head</i> some <i>Egyptian Writers</i> mention,
that because <i>Dionysius</i>, who was born in the <i>EIGHTH
MONTH</i>, lived in the <i>Island</i> of <i>NAXOS</i>; therefore
both this <i>Number</i> and the <i>Island</i> were dedicated to his
everlasting <i>Memory</i>; Whereupon, they say, he obtained
the <i>Prerogative</i> and <i>Privilege</i> from the <i>GODS</i>, that the
<i>Women</i> of <i>NAXOS</i> only, in this <i>MONTH</i>, should bring
forth in <i>Safety</i>, and their <i>CHILDREN</i> only enjoy <i>Vitality</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> <i>Fable</i> may however serve to satisfy us,
that they have had no better Opinion of an <i>Eight-Months
BIRTH</i>, in those <i>Antient Days</i>, than the Generality
of <i>Learned Men</i> yet have in these <i>Modern</i> Times:
signifying in the main, by this comical <i>Allusion</i> to that
<i>little Island</i> in the <i>Ægean Sea</i>, that if, peradventure, an
<i>Octimestrian <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>, by its more propitious <i>Destiny</i>,
should be determined to <i>Life</i>; <i>that</i> ought to be looked
upon as something <i>Extraordinary</i>, and not laid down
for any general <i>Hypothesis</i>: especially for this manifest
Reason, because in all <i>other Nations</i>, such <i>CHILDREN</i>
are commonly observed to be but short-liv’d; as the
<i>Women</i>, labouring with <i>CHILD</i> at that critical<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c017'><sup>[122]</sup></a> or fatal
<i>TIME</i>, are absolutely exposed to the severest of
<i>excruciating PAINS</i>, and the greatest of <i>imminent DANGERS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, <i>Hippocrates</i> himself testifies, that
the very <i>Gestation</i><a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c017'><sup>[123]</sup></a> of the <i>eighth Month</i> is the most
<i>onerous</i> and <i>difficult</i> of all the Time, as well on account
of the <i>Indisposition</i> of the <i>Womb</i>, as by reason of the
<i>Mother’s</i> being affected by the <i>disturbing Motions</i> of the
<i>Infant</i>: Wherefore if the <i>Birth</i> then draws on, it receives
a double Damage, and suffers as well because of
these <i>Affections</i> of the <i>Mother</i> and <i>Womb</i>, as by its own
proper <i>Motions</i> in precipitating itself.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> what is said, we may easily comprehend
what <i>HIPPOCRATES</i> means by that obscure<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c017'><sup>[124]</sup></a> <i>Ænigma</i>,
which some have formerly reckoned more inextricable
than any <i>Herculean Knot</i>, viz. <i>An Octimestrian Birth
is and is not</i>; signifying thereby nothing else than that
the <i>Child born</i> in the <i>eighth Month</i> (in some respect) may
be supposed in <i>Being</i>, but really and indeed <i>is not</i>, because
it soon vanishes and <i>dies</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> Generality of <i>Modern Writers</i> have too strictly
confined a <i>Legitimate</i> <span class='sc'>Birth</span>, and tied it down
to this very <span class='sc'>Month</span> only; and <i>some</i> even restrain it to
the narrow <i>Limits</i> of its <i>Latter Half</i>: Both equally
affirming <i>That</i> <span class='sc'>Time</span> to produce the most vigorous and
lively <i>Children</i>, and strenuously alledging it to be the <i>only</i>
appointed <span class='sc'>Time</span> of <i>Nature</i>; because (as they say) <i>it
happens most frequently</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> unless they could produce some better <i>natural
Reasons</i> than <span class='sc'>This</span>, or any <i>others</i> indeed that I have yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>heard of, they shall scarce <i>influence</i> me to agree with
their popular <i>Notions</i> or vulgar Errors: For their fond
Opinion seems not to be so much supported by any
<i>Arguments</i> of <i>Natural Reason</i>, as by an <i>imaginary Experience</i>,
founded upon <i>Hearsay</i>, or the <i>general Misconstruction</i>
of <span class='sc'>Women</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, in Condescension and Good-Manners
to <i>Female Authority</i> (to which I owe all imaginable
<i>Deference</i>) I shall not launch out into any immodest or
disagreeable <i>Contradictions</i>; but, on the contrary, I shall
endeavour to make it evidently appear from the <i>Nature</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Month</span> itself, that it indisputably induceth
both <i>Perfection</i> and <i>Vitality</i> to the <span class='sc'>Child</span>, whether it be
<i>born</i> at this <i>Time</i> or not: For I must frankly own this
<i>Truth</i> indeed, that many <i>Auspicious</i> <span class='sc'>Births</span> happen in
this very same <span class='sc'>Month</span>, for several good Reasons.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>BECAUSE</em> <i>then</i>, if we will believe <i>Astrologers</i>,
<span class='sc'>Jupiter</span> now returns with his <i>Serene Aspect</i>, by his pure
healing <i>Heat</i> and <i>Humidity</i>, cherishing and renovating
the <i>Life</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> (which consists of those two <i>vital
Qualities</i>) and quite effacing the former <i>Mischiefs</i> and
<i>Injuries</i> of noxious <span class='sc'>Saturn</span>: whereby he renders <i>This
ninth Month</i> not only most conducive to the <span class='sc'>Birth</span>, but
also to the future <i>Welfare</i> and <i>Prosperity</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>BECAUSE</em> this auspicious <i>Number</i> <span class='sc'>Nine</span> is
dedicated to the <span class='sc'>Muses</span>, according to the Order of the
Celestial <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Spheres</em></span>: Hence as we have <i>nine moveable
Spheres</i>, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Primum Mobile</i>, the <i>Starry Heaven</i>, and
the <i>Spheres</i> of <i>SATURN</i>, <i>JUPITER</i>, <i>MARS</i>, <i>SOL</i>,
<i>VENUS</i>, <i>MERCURY</i>, and <i>LUNA</i>; so there are <i>Nine</i>
<span class='sc'>Muses</span> appropriated to them, to accomplish their <i>Harmony</i>
or <i>Consort</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>BECAUSE</em> to denote the <i>Sufficiency</i> of this
<span class='sc'>Number</span>, there are also <i>nine</i> <span class='sc'>Orders</span> and <span class='sc'>Choirs</span> of
blessed <span class='sc'>Angels</span>; namely, <i>Seraphims</i>, <i>Cherubims</i>, <i>Thrones</i>,
<i>Dominations</i>, <i>Powers</i>, <i>Virtues</i>, <i>Principalities</i>, <i>Archangels</i>,
and <i>Angels</i>: Which the <i>Prophet EZEKIEL</i><a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c017'><sup>[125]</sup></a> emblematically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>figures out by Nine <span class='sc'>Stones</span>; as the <i>Saphire</i>, <i>Emerald</i>,
<i>Carbuncle</i>, <i>Beril</i>, <i>Onyx</i>, <i>Chrysolite</i>, <i>Jasper</i>, <i>Topaz</i>,
and the <i>Sardis</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> besides the <i>Nine</i> internal and external <span class='sc'>Senses</span>,
mentioned in <i>Sect.</i> I. <i>Chap.</i> 5. more plainly and
familiarly denote the <i>Perfection</i> of this <span class='sc'>Number</span>: As,
in like manner, the most learned <i>Authors</i> of all Ages
take great Notice of it in the <span class='sc'>Age</span> of <i>Man</i>, calling <i>this
Ninth</i>, together with the <i>Seventh</i>, <span class='sc'>Climacterical</span> <i>Years</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOT</em> to mention the <i>Ninth Hour</i>, in which our
Blessed <span class='sc'>Saviour</span> breathed out his Holy Spirit; the
<i>Ninth Day</i> the <i>Antients</i> buried their <span class='sc'>Dead</span>, and many
such remarkable Instances. Yet however, in most
<i>Natural</i> and <i>Philosophical Cases</i>, this <span class='sc'>Number</span> implies
still some <i>Imperfection</i>; because it comes short of the
<i>Complement</i> of the Great <i>Number</i> <span class='sc'>Ten</span> (being deficient
by <span class='sc'>One</span>) as St. <i>Austin</i> interprets it of the <span class='sc'>Ten Lepers</span>.
Wherefore not to go too far in these <span class='sc'>Mystical</span>
<i>Matters</i>, I proceed to</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to this Point, it is not only True in <i>Part</i>; to
wit, <i>during the First Ten Days</i> of the <i>10th Month</i>,
as <span class='sc'>Some</span> would have it, but rather (in my Opinion)
<i>Altogether</i>, and at any time of it, as <span class='sc'>Legitimate</span> as the
<i>9th Month</i>; according to <i>Plautus</i> the Comick <i>Poet</i>; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tunc

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> altho’ <i>Women</i> commonly reckon their <span class='sc'>Births</span>
more frequent in the <i>Ninth Month</i>; yet many <i>Learned
Men</i> have left it (as a doubtful Controversy) undecided
whether <span class='sc'>That</span> or <span class='sc'>This</span> be the most proper natural
Time: Whereas <i>Some</i> of the <i>first</i> <span class='sc'>Rank</span><a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c017'><sup>[126]</sup></a> have more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>positively determined a <i>Legitimate BIRTH</i> to happen in
the <i>Tenth Month</i> <span class='sc'>Only</span>, according also to <i>Virgil</i>’s excellent
Poetical Computation—</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, for a farther Proof of this Argument,
I need only refer to <i>Solomon</i>, the wisest of
<i>Kings</i>; who being the greatest <i>Master of all ARTS</i>,
cannot be supposed to have been ignorant of This
<i>Truth</i>: And whose express Decision of this Doubt, we
have set down in the Beginning of the 7th <i>Chapter</i> of
his <i>Book</i> of <i>WISDOM</i>; saying, “<i>I myself also am a
mortal Man, and the Offspring of him that was first made
of the Earth</i>, <i>and in my Mother’s Womb was fashioned
to be Flesh in the time of TEN MONTHS</i>, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> farther yet, as to the <i>Nature</i> of this <i>Month</i>,
<i>MARS</i> is presumed to succeed in it, who indulges the
<span class='sc'>Infant</span> by his <i>amicable Qualities</i>, or <i>benign Influences</i>:
For <i>He</i> is deemed a Friend to <i>LIFE</i>, as he affords <i>Vitality</i>
to the <i>BIRTHS</i> happening in it.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> again, this <i>Number</i> <span class='sc'>Ten</span> is reckoned a <i>Compleat</i>
and <i>Universal</i> <span class='sc'>Number</span> in all <i>Sciences</i>; because we
cannot account beyond it, but by <i>Replication</i>, a <i>Re-assumption</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Unit</span>, or <i>Repetition</i> of the <i>Nine Figures</i>,
to perfect the Progression. But farther still, to denote
the Excellency and Perfection of this <span class='sc'>Month</span>, there are
<span class='sc'>Ten</span> <i>Singers</i> of <i>Psalms</i> mentioned in Holy Scripture;
namely, <i>ADAM</i>, <i>ABRAHAM</i>, <i>MELCHISEDECH</i>,
<i>MOSES</i>, <i>ASAPH</i>, <i>DAVID</i>, <i>SOLOMON</i>, and the <i>three
Sons of CHORAH</i>: <span class='sc'>Ten</span> <i>Musical Instruments</i>: <span class='sc'>Ten</span> <i>Strings</i>
in the <i>Psaltery</i>: <span class='sc'>Ten</span> <i>Curtains</i> in the <i>Temple</i>: <span class='sc'>Ten</span> <i>Commandments</i>
instituted and given directly by <span class='sc'>God</span> himself:
<span class='sc'>And</span>, in fine, the <span class='sc'>Tenth</span> Day after <i>Ascension</i> the
<i>HOLY GHOST</i> came down, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THERE</em> are besides also <span class='sc'>Ten</span> <i>Parts</i>, of which
<span class='sc'>Man</span> himself consists intrinsically; <i>viz.</i> the <i>Spirit</i>,
<i>Brain</i>, <i>Lungs</i>, <i>Heart</i>, <i>Liver</i>, <i>Gall</i>, <i>Spleen</i>, <i>Kidneys</i>, <i>Testicles</i>,
and <i>Matrix</i>: And likewise <span class='sc'>Ten</span> <i>Simple Integral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Parts</i> constituting the <span class='sc'>Man</span>, to wit, <i>Bone</i>, <i>Cartilage</i>,
<i>Nerve</i>, <i>Fibre</i>, <i>Ligament</i>, <i>Artery</i>, <i>Vein</i>, <i>Membrane</i>, <i>Flesh</i>,
and <i>Skin</i>. In short just so, after this manner, there are
<span class='sc'>Ten</span> <i>Months</i> required to form and maturate the <i>MAN</i>,
in the substantial <i>Completion</i> of <span class='sc'>These</span> to Perfection.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em>, after All, lest I should be thought, by this
way of Reasoning on the <i>Numbers</i> of the <i>MONTHS</i>, to
vend some fictitious <i>Notions</i> for mechanical <i>Causes</i>, or vain
<i>Fictions</i> for the <i>Laws of Nature</i>, I shall in this Place, to
avoid that Censure or Reproach, make a small <i>Digression</i>,
and that upon <i>NUMBERS</i> in general.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em> then, I think it appears very Plain from
the <i>Three preceding Chapters</i>, that <i>NUMBERS</i> are of a
certain wonderful Efficacy and Virtue even in <span class='sc'>Supernaturals</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, In <i>Natural Things</i> also the Virtues
of <i>NUMBERS</i> (so <i>mystically</i> constituted and <i>mysteriously</i>
intended) are conspicuously manifest: As is evident
in the <i>Herb</i>, call’d <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Pentaphyllon</span></em>, which is said
to resist <i>Poisons</i> by Virtue of <i>Number FIVE</i>; as <i>one Leaf</i>
of it taken <i>twice</i> a day in <i>Wine</i>, cures the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Quotidian</span></em>;
<i>three</i>, the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Tertian</span></em>; and four, the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Quartan</span></em> <i>Fever</i>.
So likewise in the <i>Herb</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Heliotropium Tricoccon</em></span><a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c017'><sup>[127]</sup></a>,
<i>three Grains</i> whereof cures the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Tertian</span></em>: and <i>four</i>,
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Quartan</span></em> <i>Ague</i>. In like manner, as a <i>Serpent</i>,
if struck <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Once</span></em> with a <i>Spear</i>, <i>dies</i>; but if <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Twice</span></em>, is
said to recover <i>Strength</i>. So much for the Curious.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, These and many other Things
might be mentioned, both in <i>Natural</i>, and <i>Supernatural
Beings</i>, upon the wonderful <i>Power</i> and <i>Efficacy</i> of <i>NUMBERS</i>:
Which plausible <i>Doctrine</i> not only the most
Eminent <i>Philosophers</i>, but also the most Learned <i>Catholick
DOCTORS</i>, namely, St. <i>Jerom</i>, <i>Austin</i>, <i>Origen</i>, <i>Ambrose</i>,
<i>Athanasius</i>, &amp;c. All unanimously teach; as well
as the most famous Dr. <i>Rabanus</i> (Archbishop of <i>Mentz</i>)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>who in his Time compos’d an excellent <i>Book</i> to this
purpose chiefly upon the <i>Virtues</i> of Numbers.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> notwithstanding all This, I am far from believing
that there is any peculiar <i>Virtue</i> in <i>NUMBERS</i>,
considered <i>abstractedly</i>: Only, I would hereby demonstrate,
that as the <i>Omniscient CREATOR</i> has appointed
every thing a <i>certain TIME</i> for its <i>Production</i>, <i>Augmentation</i>,
<i>Perfection</i>, <i>Declension</i>, and <i>Duration</i>; so in all probability,
the same <i>Decree</i> or Good-Will of <i>Divine Providence</i>
may have ordered <i>NUMBERS</i>, and <i>Sett-Days</i> or
<i>Times</i> to concur with the apparent Necessity of <i>Corporeal</i>,
<i>Natural</i>, and <i>Mechanical</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Causes</em></span>. For in Truth,
at last, I cannot think that, unless there had been some
great and distinct <i>Mysterys</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><i>GOD</i></em> and <i>Nature</i> comprehended
in <i>NUMBERS</i>, the Great <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Divine</em></span><a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c017'><sup>[128]</sup></a> would
otherwise have recommended That <i>Search</i> to the
World of Understanding to count the <i>NUMBER</i> of
the <i>Beast</i>: saying, <i>It is the Number of a Man</i>. But to
proceed:</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXXVII.</span><br /> <i>Of an Eleven-Months, and all posteriour <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>As</em> to this <span class='sc'>Month</span>, many <i>Authors</i><a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c017'><sup>[129]</sup></a> agree to legitimate
its <i>BIRTH</i>; because of several repeated <i>Instances</i> that
really happen’d in their Days: To which I can add
<i>ONE</i> of my own proper <i>Experience</i>, during my itinerant
<i>Practice</i> in the City of <i>Prague</i>. Where, as I came recommended
to the Acquaintance of some Eminent <i>Physicians</i>
of the Place, I happen’d once to be call’d (by <i>one</i> of them)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>to a <i>Lady</i> in <span class='sc'>Labour</span>; whom I had the good Fortune
to deliver immediately, of a fine, lusty, and lively
<i>Girl</i>. After which, I had the Honour to attend her in
<i>Child-Bed</i>; I mean, to visit and prescribe for her, by
the concurring Advice of my Honoured <i>Friend</i> (the
most Learned and Ingenious Dr. <i>Von Overberg</i>, who was
her near Relation) in order to prevent some <i>Disasters</i>
under which she had formerly suffer’d on the like Occasion.
Upon This, she was pleas’d to tell me out of
her own Mouth, that, before the <i>Day</i> of her <span class='sc'>Delivery</span>,
her <i>Husband</i>, (who was a <i>Colonel</i> in the Imperial Service)
had been gone to the <i>Army</i>, then in <i>Sicily</i>, <span class='sc'>Ten Months</span>
and <i>two Days</i>; so that this <i>Proculean</i> <span class='sc'>Child</span> was born
(at soonest) the <i>Third Day</i> of the <i>Eleventh Month</i>. And
in this <i>Case</i>, I dare say, I was no ways mistaken, or
impos’d upon; that <i>Lady</i> being endued with no less
true <i>Honour</i> and strict <i>Virtue</i>, than she was otherways
deservedly esteem’d, of a singular good <i>Character</i>, and
great <i>Distinction</i> in that Place.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> which happy Occasion, I was the first
Time fully satisfy’d, and convinc’d, as to the due Proportion
and Distinction of the <i>Four controverted Terms</i>;
<i>viz.</i> that, by how much the <i>latter Part</i> of the <span class='sc'>Tenth
Month</span> is preferable to the <i>Beginning</i> of the <span class='sc'>Ninth</span>; by
so much is the <i>Beginning</i> of the <span class='sc'>Eleventh</span>, preferable to
any <i>BIRTH</i><a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c017'><sup>[130]</sup></a> happening in the <i>latter Part</i> of the <span class='sc'>Seventh
Month</span>: So that, upon the whole Matter, I
can find no plausible Reason why All <i>Those</i> may not be
accounted <i>Legitimate terms</i> of Time in <i>Child-Bearing</i>, as
well as the <i>latter Part</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Ninth</span></em>, and <i>Beginning</i> of
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Tenth Month</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> probable Opinion we may the more readily
agree to, and acquiesce in; especially because (if
what has been said of the rest of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Planets</span></em>, in the
respective <i>Chapters</i> of <i>This</i> and the <i>First SECTION</i>, be
true) the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Sun</span></em> in this <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Eleventh Month</span></em> returns to
take care of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Infant</span></em> (yet unborn;) by virtue of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>whose vivacious <i>Influence</i> and beneficent <i>Quality</i>, <i>BIRTHS</i>
of this <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Month</span></em> are accounted no less <i>vital</i> and <i>successful</i>,
than any <i>others</i> differently time’d.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THERE</em> are also many <i>Authors</i>, over and above,
who make mention of <i>BIRTHS</i>, in the <i>Twelfth</i>, <i>Thirteenth</i>,
<i>Fourteenth</i>, and <i>Fifteenth</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Month</span></em>. Yes verily,
and there is <i>one remarkable Instance</i>, of the Physical <i>College</i>
at <i>Montpelier</i>, where a grand <i>Consultation</i> was held about
the Year 1590, in <i>Favour</i> of a certain <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Marchioness</span></em>;
who (after some fair <i>Legitimate BIRTHS</i>) had <i>Two</i><a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c017'><sup>[131]</sup></a>
running successively, the <i>one</i> in the <i>Eighteenth</i>, the <i>other</i>
in the <i>Twentieth</i> <span class='sc'>Month</span>: upon which, divers curious
<i>Reasonings</i> happened, and various <i>Sentiments</i> were deliver’d.
However, because such <i>Precedents</i> are so very
few and uncommon, I shall take up no more <i>Time</i> about
them. Only</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to what is said in this, and the preceding Chapters,
touching the <i>Months</i>, I desire to be understood, as
meaning <i>Solar</i>, not <i>Lunar</i> Months: By <i>Solar</i> Months, I
mean that Space of Time, which the <i>Sun</i> continues in
either, or every, <i>Sign</i> of the <i>Zodiack</i>, comprehending
thirty Days.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> it may (perhaps) be objected, that the <i>Antients</i>
(especially the <i>Greeks</i>) reckon’d their Years by
<i>Lunar Revolutions</i> only, and had none else but <i>Lunar
Months</i>. To which I answer, that the <i>Wise</i> and <i>Divine
HIPPOCRATES</i> computes<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c017'><sup>[132]</sup></a> the Time of <i>Birth</i> by <i>Decads
of Weeks</i>; which <i>Decad</i> contains Seventy, as every
Week consists of Seven full Days: Hence <i>He</i> makes
out the Legitimacy of a <i>Seven-Months Child</i>; because
that <i>Term</i> comprehends <i>three Decads</i> of Weeks, or 210
Days: And hence it is evident, that he has measur’d
that Time of <i>Gestation</i> by <i>Solar</i> Months, of which each
contains 30 Days, answering alike in <i>Births</i> of all
Months. For if we <i>divide</i> those 210 Days by 7, for
the Number of Months, we shall find a <i>Quotient</i> of 30
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Days to each; or if we <i>multiply</i> 30 by 7, we’ll find
a <i>Product</i> of 210 Days in all. And this <i>Computation</i> he
farther elucidates, saying<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c017'><sup>[133]</sup></a>, <i>As thirty Suns form the Fœtus,
so seventy move it, and two hundred and ten perfect it</i>.
Hence it is evident and certain, that <span class='sc'>Hippocrates</span> also
considered and regarded the <i>Circuits</i> of the <i>Sun</i>. Which
leads me farther, to</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXXVIII.</span><br /> <i>Of the Reasons why <em class='gesperrt'>ONE</em> Number of Months, Weeks, and Days, is more Auspicious to <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em>, than <em class='gesperrt'>ANOTHER</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>WHAT</em> has been said in the <i>Seven preceeding Chapters</i>
particularly, concerning <i>Months</i>, <i>Weeks</i>, &amp;c.
leads me directly to descant upon <em class='gesperrt'><i>THESE</i></em> in general:
Which <i>Topick</i>, tho’ I could willingly resign it to the
more <i>Judicious</i> to enter upon, and recommend to the
more <i>Learned</i> to discuss; yet lest I may be thought to
evade or omit any material <i>Point</i> which I have undertaken,
I shall endeavour (according to the Best of my
weak <i>Capacity</i>) to explain, <i>en passant</i>, and to unfold this
<i>Mystery</i>, by declaring the most plausible <i>Orthodox Reasons</i>
why <i>ONE Number of Days, Weeks and Months, is more
Auspicious to the BIRTH</i>, and affords more <i>Vitality</i> to the
<span class='sc'>Child</span> than <i>ANOTHER</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> handling of which <i>Subject-Matter</i>, as I propose
to be very <i>Brief</i>, so I shall only observe in short, that
such <i>Reasons</i> are chiefly founded upon a <i>double Principle</i>;
That is, of daily <i>Experience</i>, and natural <i>Knowledge</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> daily <i>Experience</i>; in that it is notoriously
well known that <span class='sc'>Children</span> born in <i>different Months</i>, are
not equally <i>Vital</i> or <i>Lively</i>; and in that it is evidently
manifest, that the <i>7th</i>, <i>9th</i>, and <i>10th</i>, and perhaps the
<i>11th Month</i> also, are endued with some certain <i>Virtues</i>,
and prevalent <i>Qualitys</i> before all <span class='sc'>Others</span> in this Case.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>II. <em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> Natural <i>Knowledge</i>; insomuch that it is
the Opinion of all Judicious <i>Naturalists</i> (either <i>Philosophers</i>
or <i>Physicians</i>) that this <i>inferiour World</i> is moved and
govern’d by <i>superiour Bodys</i>, and that all <i>Terrestrial Vicissitudes</i>
and <i>Changes</i> depend upon <i>Cælestials</i>, and those
chiefly upon the <span class='sc'>Sun</span> and <span class='sc'>Moon</span>: which both possess
great <i>influential Virtues</i>, and exercise great directing
<i>Powers</i> over all <i>Inferiour Bodys</i>. From hence the <i>Antients</i>
always maintain’d, that the <i>Periodical Accessions</i> and <i>Circulations</i>
of many <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Distempers</em></span> depended entirely on
their noxious <i>Influences</i>; especially upon that of the
<em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em>, because of her <i>Proximity</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NAY</em>, some <i>Authors</i> have advanced so far, as to
ascribe the only <i>Cause</i> of them to the <i>Powers</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stars</em></span>
and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Planets</em></span>. But tho’ I am no ways to countenance
<i>These Notions</i> to this ridiculous Length, nor in the least
to defend the vain <i>Fictions</i>, or foolish <i>Ostentations</i> of the
vulgar <i>ASTROLOGERS</i>; yet I shall make no scruple
to assert that both the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stars</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Planets</em></span> are concurring
or co-operating, tho not sole <i>efficient Causes</i>, in
these <i>Cases</i>: And This, I hope, I may rationally be
allow’d to do, supposing I had not the direct <i>Authority</i>
of such a Great Man, as the most Learned and
Excellent Dr. <i>Mead</i><a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c017'><sup>[134]</sup></a>, over and above to back me;
who says, “<i>It is moreover to be consider’d, that the rest of
the</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stars</em></span> <i>and</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Planets</em></span> <i>have each their Power and Influence,
which tho’ they be not Equal to that of the</i> <span class='sc'>Sun</span>
<i>and</i> <span class='sc'>Moon</span>; <i>yet notwithstanding they conspire to augment
or diminish their Powers on human Bodys; and this Concourse
is of so great Consequence</i> (says this Eminent Author)
<i>that we must refer to it the sudden and hidden
Power of most Distempers in all Countries</i>, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> the <i>Powers</i> of the two great and glorious
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Luminarys</em></span>, we are more <i>sensible</i> of, as they are more
manifestly <i>conspicuous</i>; and <i>These</i> we may in many other
<i>Cases</i>, (as well as in <i>BIRTHS</i>) hold for <i>efficient Causes</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> who knows not that the Influence of the
<span class='sc'>Sun</span> fructifies all sorts of <i>Grain</i>, and ripens <i>Fruit</i>, <i>Corn</i>,
&amp;c? Who knows not that by its <i>Force</i> or <i>Influx</i> only,
divers <i>Animals</i>, <i>Insects</i>, &amp;c. engender and spring out of
the <i>Dust</i> and the <i>Earth</i>? Or, who knows not that its
<i>Power</i> prompts all Creatures to <i>Coition</i>, and excites them
to propagate their respective <i>Species</i>, each one its own
<i>Kind</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NEITHER</em> is the <i>Influence</i> of the <span class='sc'>Moon</span> less evident:
For does it not change the <i>Constitution</i> of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Weather</em></span>, raise the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Air</em></span>, heighten the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Winds</em></span>, swell
and exagitate the <i>Surface</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sea</em></span>, and finally, augment
and increase the very <i>Tides</i> of the <span class='sc'>Ocean</span>? Do
not all <i>Animals</i>, as well as the <i>Menstruous</i> and <i>Pregnant
Woman</i> sensibly feel the <i>Power</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lunar</em></span> <i>Influence</i>?
Yes verily, as my last quoted <i>Author</i> justly<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c017'><sup>[135]</sup></a> observes,
<i>unless their REGIMEN be perverted, by which means the
Body may be disqualify’d or rendred unapt to receive the Impression</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> <i>this</i> does not only happen to <i>Four-footed
Beasts</i>, and all that possess the dry <i>LAND</i>; but also

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> Things then being evidently so, and it
being a most certain and undeniable <i>Truth</i>, that the
<span class='sc'>Sun</span> and <span class='sc'>Moon</span> have each their respective <i>Influence</i> upon
all <i>Inferiour Bodys</i>: (as has also been already shewn in
<i>Sect.</i> I. <i>Chap.</i> 8.) I come now to observe that such <i>Mutations</i>
as are <i>Quick</i> and <i>Brief</i>, or such <i>Changes</i> as are accomplished
in a <i>Few Days</i>, may be entirely ascribed to
the <i>Power</i> of the <span class='sc'>Moon</span>: As in the <i>Reverse</i> of these
<i>Cases</i>, which cannot be determin’d under a <i>Long Time</i>;
the <i>Course</i> of the <span class='sc'>Sun</span> is more chiefly to be consider’d
and principally regarded.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SO</em> <i>Acute Fevers</i> (because <i>SHORT</i>) are generally
assuaged and dissolved in <i>14 Days</i>: Whereas <i>Quartans</i>
(because <i>LONG</i>) on the contrary are only determin’d
in <i>six Months</i>. It’s true indeed, the <i>Antients</i> ascribed
these <i>Laws</i> of <span class='sc'>Nature</span>, to <i>Pythagorean Numbers</i>, and
distinguish’d the <i>Times</i> of <span class='sc'>Fevers</span> according to their
<i>Critical Days</i>, which they strictly animadverted, as they
laid great <i>Stress</i> upon that Ceremonious Observation.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, <i>Galen</i> made a far stricter <i>Disquisition</i>
in this Matter, and conceiv’d (as the <i>Truth</i> indeed is)
that the <i>Accessions</i> and <i>Crises</i> of <span class='sc'>Fevers</span> had no <i>Connexion</i>
with any <i>NUMBERS</i> or <i>odd Days</i>, but took <i>Origin</i> only
from the <i>Efficacy</i> of the <span class='sc'>Moon</span>: (as is more fully explain’d
in <i>Chap.</i> 28. of this <i>Section</i>.) According to which
<i>MAXIM</i><a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c017'><sup>[138]</sup></a>, <i>Acute Distempers</i> have their <i>Circulations</i> in
<i>Seven Days</i>, and take their <i>Accesses</i> and <i>Declinations</i> from
the <i>Course</i> of the <span class='sc'>Moon</span>; which every <i>Seventh Day</i>,
when <span class='sc'>New</span>, <span class='sc'>Half-Full</span>, or <span class='sc'>Full</span>, has her greatest
<i>Influence</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> farther observes that the <i>Quarter-Day</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Moon</span> may fall upon the <i>6th</i> or <i>8th</i> Day of the <span class='sc'>Distemper</span>,
and consequently <i>either</i> of <i>these Days</i> may determine
it as well as the <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEVENTH</em></i>. For (according to
Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s excellent Judgment) the <i>Dissolution</i> of a
<span class='sc'>Fever</span> sometimes happens <i>To-day</i>, which according to
the ordinary <i>Course</i> of the <span class='sc'>Distemper</span> ought to happen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span><i>To-morrow</i>; or, on the contrary, the <i>same</i> may be procrastinated
till <i>To-morrow</i>, which might be expected <i>To-day</i>:
And <i>That</i> for the various <i>Reasons</i><a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c017'><sup>[139]</sup></a> most ingeniously
by him alledg’d and irrefragably established.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> fine, such <i>Mutations</i> and <i>Circulations</i> of Things
as are perfected and perform’d in a <i>few Days</i>, are directed
by the <i>Property</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span>: whereas such
<i>Changes</i> and <i>Alterations</i> as require the Dissolution and
Determination of <i>Months</i>, refer only to the <i>Government</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Sun</span>. Which I would have thus candidly understood,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> from the beginning of the <i>Month</i> to the <span class='sc'>Full-Moon</span>
are almost <i>14 Days</i>, which accomplish half the
<i>Lunar Circuit</i>, and comprehend two <i>Quarter-Changes</i>;
so from the Beginning of <i>Spring</i> to the End of <i>Summer</i>
are six <i>Months</i>, which comprehend <i>two Seasons</i> or half of
the Year: And so that <i>Mediety</i> or <i>Half of the Month</i>, from
<i>FULL-MOON</i>, to the Time of <i>Occultation</i> or <i>NEW-MOON</i>,
answers to the other <i>six Months</i>, from the beginning
of <i>Autumn</i> to the last of <i>Winter</i>, which conclude
the other Half of the Year.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> as we divide the <i>Course</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MOON</em></i> by <i>4
Weeks</i>, according to its 4 quarter <i>Changes</i>; so we distribute
the <i>Course</i> of the <i>SUN</i> into <i>4 Stations</i>, according
to the <i>four Seasons</i> of the Year: Hence it is that all
<i>Times</i> of the <i>Year</i> answer in proportion to the different
<i>Weeks</i> of the <i>Month</i>, and all <i>Stations</i> of the <i>SUN</i> (in
like manner) to the different <i>Changes</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MOON</em></i>.
Wherefore as the <i>7th Day</i>, which is the 4th Part of
the <i>Lunar Month</i>, determines <i>acute Distempers</i>; so the
<i>Change</i> of the <i>Season</i> of the Year dissolves <i>Diuturnal Diseases</i>.
The <i>SPRING</i> commonly shakes off any <i>Malady</i>
generated in <i>WINTER</i>, as the <i>SUMMER</i> does what
is begun in the <i>SPRING</i>; and the <i>AUTUMN</i> discusseth
any <i>Affection</i> excited in <i>SUMMER</i>, as the <i>WINTER</i>
does what happen’d in <i>AUTUMN</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> Things being thus cleared-up by the
way, we have now only to consider, that the Time of
<i>GESTATION</i> is no <i>Acute</i>, but a <i>Diuturnal Effect</i>; and
that <span class='sc'>Birth</span> is nothing else but the <span class='sc'>Crisis</span> of the same
<i>Affection</i>, according to<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c017'><sup>[140]</sup></a><i>Hippocrates</i>’s Sense. Which,
if so, it is evidently manifest that, in defining the <i>Time</i>
of <span class='sc'>Birth</span>, we ought chiefly to regard the <i>Course</i> of the
<i>SUN</i>, and strictly observe the <i>Number</i> of <i>MONTHS</i>;
However so, as not to neglect the <i>Motions</i> of the
<i>MOON</i>, and consequently, we ought also to consider
duly the neat <i>Number</i> of <i>DAYS</i>: Wherefore (I say)
in <span class='sc'>Birth</span> we are to have a just Regard to, and take
a strict Observation of, not only the <i>Changes</i> of the
<i>MOON</i>, but also of the <i>Mutations</i> of the <i>SUN</i>; because
both the <i>One</i> and the <i>Other</i> act very powerfully in
<i>BIRTH</i>. Which I thus beg leave to illustrate as follows,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> the <i>first seven Days</i> have the greatest Power of
determining <i>Acute Diseases</i>, so the <i>first three Months</i> of
<i>GESTATION</i> (which answer to those Days) determine
the <i>CONCEPTION</i>: And as of <i>those</i> the <i>7th Day</i> is
the most powerful, so of <i>these</i> the <i>third Month</i> is the most
prevalent. From hence it is that the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span> suffers such
manifest <i>Alterations</i> and <i>Changes</i> of Nature in this
<span class='sc'>Month</span>: For it is now metamorphos’d or chang’d from
an <i>Inanimate</i> into an <i>Animate Being</i>: It now becomes a
<i>Living</i> and <i>Moving Body</i>, subsisting henceforward by its
own proper vivacious <i>Faculties</i>; yet not so however,
that <i>this</i> <span class='sc'>Month</span> can be presum’d to produce a <i>vital
Birth</i>: No, because as every perfect and plausible <i>CRISIS</i>
of the <i>7th Day</i>, requires the <i>Concurrence</i> of the digested
<i>Humour</i>, together with the <i>Ability</i> and <i>Strength</i>
of the <em class='gesperrt'><i>PATIENT</i></em>; so in <span class='sc'>Birth</span>, the <i>Disposition</i> of
the <em class='gesperrt'><i>INFANT</i></em> must necessarily concur with all <i>These</i>,
which it can never be suppos’d to do in the short Space
of <i>Three Months</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em> again, as the <i>Days</i> of the Interval
from the <i>7th</i> to the <i>14th</i>, have but small
<i>Power</i> in dissolving <i>acute Diseases</i>; so neither have the
<i>4th</i> or <i>5th Months</i> (which assimilate <i>these Days</i>) any
<i>Efficacy</i> tending to <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Birth</span></em>. Wherefore if an unlucky
<i>Ejection</i> of the <i>Foetus</i> happens in <i>these Months</i>, it can
be no otherwise judged of, than as when <i>Symptomatical</i>
(not <i>Critical</i>) <i>Excretions</i> fall out on <span class='sc'>Days</span> not <i>Decretory</i>:
Hence we (of consequence) may collect, that the very
<i>First Time</i>, in which a <i>legitimate Term</i> can be suppos’d
to concur effectually, together with the <i>Disposition</i> and
<i>Strength</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>, in case of <span class='sc'>Birth</span>, will be (as
<i>Hippocrates</i> has well observed<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c017'><sup>[141]</sup></a>) about the <i>182d Day</i>, or
at the <i>half Year’s End</i>: Which (however) he calls a
<i>Septimestrian</i> <span class='sc'>Birth</span>, because the <i>Ancients</i> reckon’d their
Year by <i>Lunar Months</i>, as they did their <i>Months</i> by the
Course of the <span class='sc'>Moon</span>; whereof 13 with some <i>Days</i> of
the <i>14th Month</i> constitute the <i>Solar Year</i>: Not that I
mean they in the Interim were at all ignorant of the
<i>Solar Periods</i>. And however, tho’ this <i>Number of 182
Days</i> make but up <i>six Solar Months</i>; yet, as it comprehends
<i>seven Lunar Months</i>, and almost constitutes three
<span class='sc'>Decades</span> of <i>Lunar Weeks</i>, there can be no <i>Repugnancy</i>
in that <i>Wise Man’s Meaning</i>, whatever some literal <i>Interpreters</i>
may imagine to the contrary.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> this <i>sixth Month</i> being the <i>second Solar Mutation</i>,
in it the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> begins to be more severely oppress’d
with the <i>Weight</i> and <i>Bulk</i> of its Burthen; for
now the <i>INFANT</i> has assum’d <i>Perfection</i>, and (perhaps)
got <i>Strength</i> sufficient to undergo its <i>Fatigue</i> in <span class='sc'>Labour</span>,
and <i>Power</i> enough to support <i>Life</i>, after its <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Birth</span></em>;
especially if procreated of the more vivid, valid, or
excellent <span class='sc'>Seed</span>; whose powerful <i>Faculty</i> and vigorous
<i>Quality</i> may perhaps have perform’d the Work of <i>Formation</i>
in 30, which otherwise would require 35, or
<i>more Days</i>: In this <i>Case</i> (of consequence) the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Birth</span></em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>will succeed at the above-mentioned <i>happy Time</i>; as
appears more amply from what has been already set
forth in <span class='sc'>Sect.</span> 1. <i>Chap.</i> 9.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> from what has been said, I hope it appears
highly reasonable to compute the <i>legitimate Time</i> of
<span class='sc'>Birth</span>, not only by <i>Months</i> and <i>Moons</i>, but also by
<i>Weeks</i> and <i>Days</i>: Which however yet, I look not upon
to be any very full, exact, or sufficient satisfactory
<i>Calculation</i>; because (I think) we have also just Reason
to compute this <i>Time</i> even by <i>Hours</i> and <i>Minutes</i>.
Therefore how just soever <i>Aristotle</i>’s Observation (mentioned
by <i>Pliny</i><a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c017'><sup>[142]</sup></a>) may be, <i>that no Animal expires but in
the Reflux or Ebb of the Sea</i>; I am yet positive, that
Monsieur <i>Paschal</i>’s Notion (mentioned by Doctor
<i>Mead</i><a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c017'><sup>[143]</sup></a>) <i>that all Births as well as Deaths fall out in the
Reflux, and that no Animal is born or dies in the Flux</i>,
may be rationally controverted: For I must needs
assert that, without any regard to his <i>Senarian Fluxes</i>
and <i>Refluxes</i>, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Births</span></em> happen at every <i>Hour</i> of the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Day</span></em> or <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Night</span></em>: and perhaps more naturally too
in the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Flux</span></em>, than in the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Reflux</span></em> of the <i>Sea</i>. And
this, I think, may appear evident, even from the self-same
Reasons by which he endeavours to make out the
Contrary<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c017'><sup>[144]</sup></a>; namely, that intermitting <i>Fevers</i> have their
greatest <i>Paroxisms</i> in the Time of the <span class='sc'>Flux</span>, whereas
they cease in the <span class='sc'>Reflux</span> by <i>sweating</i>: collecting from
hence, that the Motion, Vigour, and Force of <i>Distempers</i>
are chiefly advanc’d in the <i>Senary</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Flux</span></em>;
and on the contrary, that they are dissolved in the <i>Senary</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Reflux</span>. Which Observation, with respect
to <i>Fevers</i>, this most excellent <i>Doctor</i> has found experimentally<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c017'><sup>[145]</sup></a>
<i>True</i>, as a great many others have also done.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in the <i>Case</i> of a Woman in <span class='sc'>Labour</span>, as (with
Submission) I judge the <i>Paroxisms</i> to differ from the
Nature of those in a <i>Fever</i>, so I humbly conceive that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>the <i>Effect</i> must prove the <span class='sc'>Reverse</span>. For the <i>Paroxisms</i>
in <span class='sc'>Birth</span>, are nothing else than the <i>Pains</i> or <i>Pangs</i> of
<span class='sc'>Labour</span>; and who knows not that (in Case of a <i>natural
Situation</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><i>INFANT</i></em> and the <em class='gesperrt'><i>WOMB</i></em>) the
greater <i>These</i> are, the more <i>Success</i> and <i>Expedition</i> attends
the <span class='sc'>Birth</span>? And who again knows not, that in
this Case, the more vigorous <i>Motion</i> the <em class='gesperrt'><i>INFANT</i></em>
makes, and the more <i>Force</i> and <i>Strength</i> that attends
the <i>Pains</i>, the sooner the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Delivery</span></em> is perfected?
Which, of consequence, according to his own Opinion,
will fall out in the <i>Senary</i> of the <span class='sc'>Flux</span>? In fine, again
I farther observe, that, as the <span class='sc'>Reflux</span> may be the appointed
Time of Nature destinated to <i>Death</i>, so may
the <span class='sc'>Flux</span> be allotted to <span class='sc'>Birth</span>; which (in my Mind)
is as opposite to <i>Death</i>, as the <span class='sc'>Flux</span> is to the <span class='sc'>Reflux</span> of
the <i>Tide</i> of the Sea.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> I am obliged to repeat it again
here, that we ought to calculate the <i>Legitimate Time</i> of
<span class='sc'>Birth</span>, not only by <i>Months</i>, <i>Weeks</i>, and <i>Days</i>, but perhaps
also by <i>Hours</i> and <i>Minutes</i>; and <i>that</i> because, according
to the Great <i>Galen</i>’s Observation<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c017'><sup>[146]</sup></a>, as the <i>Year</i>,
<i>Month</i>, or <i>Week</i> does not consist of entire <i>Days</i>, so
neither does the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Day</span></em> of entire <i>Hours</i>: For as the <i>Year</i>
consists of 365 <i>Days</i>, six <i>Hours</i>, and a few <i>Minutes</i>; and
the <i>Month</i> of thirty <i>Days</i>, ten and a half <i>Hours</i>; and
the <i>Week</i> of seven <i>Days</i>, two <i>Hours</i>, and twenty-seven
<i>Minutes</i>; so the <i>Day</i> (in proportion) consists of 24 <i>Hours</i>
and 21 <i>Minutes</i>: From whence I conclude (with that
wise <i>Man</i>) that we can make no very nice <i>Computation</i>
in this Affair, by <i>full Days</i>, without <span class='sc'>Fractions</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> it is that the most Learned and
Inquisitive <i>Boethogynists</i>, or <i>Female Physicians</i> maintain,
that they have always observed their <span class='sc'>Women</span> to bring
forth the self-same <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Hour</span></em> of the <i>Night</i> or <i>Day</i>, in
which they conceived: And <i>This</i> also daily Experience
seems to confirm for <i>Truth</i>; because it is certain, that
most <span class='sc'>Births</span> happen in the <i>Night-Time</i>, or <i>Dawning of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the Day</i>; at which <i>Times</i>, we may very probably suppose
the Generality of <i>Parents</i> to be most employ’d that
way: Whereupon, if This be True, Mr. <i>Paschal</i>’s
Position will fall of course; and then that <i>Assertion</i> of
a <i>Legitimate BIRTH</i>’s requiring, not only a certain and
prefinite Number of <i>Days</i>, but also of <i>Hours</i> and <i>Minutes</i>,
will more rationally be establish’d in its Room:
Notwithstanding that Saying of <i>Hippocrates</i><a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c017'><sup>[147]</sup></a> himself,
after having distinguished upon the <i>Times</i> of <i>BIRTH</i>,
<i>That these Things fall out in a few Days more or less</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, in fine, from what has been said,
(I hope) the <i>Reasons</i> I have given here, why <i>one Number</i>
of <i>Months</i>, <i>Weeks</i>, and <i>Days</i> is more auspicious to
the <em class='gesperrt'><i>BIRTH</i></em>, and more fortunate to the <span class='sc'>Child</span>, than
<i>another</i>, are by this Time made manifestly clear and
self-evident. Now these Things being thus briefly accounted
for, I must proceed in the next place (with
the <span class='sc'>Reader</span>’s good Leave) to provide for and prepare
the <i>Pregnant Woman</i>, against the <i>Expiration</i> of these
<i>Months</i>, <i>Weeks</i>, and <i>Days</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THO’</em> the <i>Woman</i> ought to be cautious of her
<i>DIET</i> and <i>REGIMEN</i> during the whole time
of <i>Pregnancy</i>, as advis’d in <i>Chap.</i> 3. of this <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Section</span></em>;
yet she is now oblig’d in the <i>first place</i> (especially from
the beginning of the <i>9th</i> <span class='sc'>Month</span>) to be much more
circumspect; to use nothing but <span class='sc'>Food</span> of good <i>Nutrition</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>and easy <i>Concoction</i>, of an <i>Aperitive</i> and <i>Laxative</i>
Quality, <i>little</i> at a time, but frequently taken.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought to <i>stir</i> often, and exercise herself
<i>moderately</i>, without <i>stooping</i> or <i>bending</i> the Body too
much, lest the <em class='gesperrt'><i>UMBILICALS</i></em> may entangle the
<i>Infant</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> should discreetly rest herself at certain
Times, and indulge herself in composing <i>Sleep</i>; lying
altogether on her <span class='sc'>Back</span>, not on either <i>Side</i>, that the
<span class='sc'>Infant</span> may freely turn itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> the <i>tenth Day</i>, proper Emollient and
Laxative <i>Decoctions</i> by way of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Baths</span></em>, may necessarily
be used twice or thrice a <i>Week</i>, for moistening the
<i>Passages</i>, and facilitating the <span class='sc'>Birth</span>: Or otherwise, the
<span class='sc'>Belly</span> and proper <i>Parts</i> need only be fomented with
<i>Cloths</i>, or <i>Spunges</i> dipp’d in such <i>Decoctions</i>, and the
neighbouring <i>Places</i> anointed with apposite <i>Liniments</i> or
requisite <i>Ointments</i>: But no <i>Laconick</i> or <i>Sweating</i> <span class='sc'>Baths</span>
or <span class='sc'>Bagnio’s</span>, ought to be used at this <i>Juncture</i>; notwithstanding
some contrary <i>Opinions</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Infant</i> is to be cherish’d, and strengthen’d
by proper <i>Cordials</i> inwardly taken, as well as by outward
<i>Applications</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Room</i> or <i>Chamber</i> in which the Woman
is to undergo her <span class='sc'>Travail</span> and <i>Lying-In</i>, ought to be
conveniently <i>temperate</i>, neither too <i>cold</i> nor too <i>hot</i>: By
reason that the <i>one</i> certainly constringes and shuts the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>; as the <i>other</i> dissipates and debilitates the

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Causes</i> of a <i>Legitimate</i> or timely natural <i>Birth</i>,
are chiefly <i>Three</i>; viz. I. The suppressed or defective
<i>Respiration</i>, by the encreasing <i>Calidity</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Heart</span>; which defatigates the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> so much, that it
cannot live without more free <i>Ventilation</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>PENURY</em> or <i>Scarcity</i> of <span class='sc'>Aliment</span>; the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>
now requiring <i>More</i> than it can possibly imbibe
from the <i>Mother</i>; and therefore it is forced to seek,
what <i>Nourishment</i> it farther requires, Elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> strict <i>CONFINEMENT</i> of its narrow
<i>Lodging</i>; the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> being now too little to accommodate
and entertain the well-grown-<span class='sc'>Infant</span>: Like to
the <span class='sc'>Young</span> of <i>Birds</i> or <i>Fowls</i>; which neither finding
sufficient <i>Aliment</i> nor <i>Room</i> in the <span class='sc'>Egg</span>, restlessly seek
for <i>Both</i>, and in vain endeavour for <i>Either</i>, until at
last they break the <i>Pellicules</i>: Which as soon as the <i>Mother</i>
perceives, she scratches or pecks the <i>Shell</i>, and so
brings out the oppressed indigent <span class='sc'>Chicken</span>. Thus also
in the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>, it happens not unlike; for, when the
<i>Membranes</i> break, the <i>Humours</i> and <i>Blood</i> flow plentifully;
and upon this Occasion various <i>Pains</i> afflict the
Woman: Which are always the greater and more severe
in the <i>First BIRTH</i>; because of the <i>Coarctation</i> of
the <i>Passages</i>, besides the <i>Party</i>’s being unaccustomed to
such sorrowful Griefs, and penetrating Pains.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> the <i>Reasons</i> why <span class='sc'>Women</span> only, are so much
afflicted with dolorous <i>Pains</i> in <i>BIRTH</i> (the rest of the
<i>Creatures</i> being in a great measure of Proportion exempted
from them) ought, as some <i>Divines</i> would have
us believe, to be ascribed only to the <i>SIN</i> of the <i>First
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Woman</i>; <span class='sc'>God</span> resolving (for that Reason) to punish
her whole <span class='sc'>Sex</span>, by subjecting them to those Calamities
mentioned in the holy <i>Scripture</i><a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c017'><sup>[148]</sup></a>: “<i>I will greatly multiply
thy Sorrow</i>, <i>and thy Conception; in Sorrow thou shalt
bring forth Children</i>, &amp;c.”——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> besides this <i>Doctrine</i>, I conceive there are
<i>Four</i> very considerable <i>natural Causes</i> that may be reasonably
assign’d for it; <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>DEBILITY</i> of <i>Human Nature</i>, which in
Time of <i>Labour</i> requires sometimes the whole <i>Strength</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>, and sometimes that of the <i>INFANT</i>
too; and that commonly above what <i>Either</i> can well
afford.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <span class='fss'>THE</span> dull <i>Sedentary Life</i> which <i>Women</i> generally
lead and indulge themselves in; as appears plain from
what I have often observed in <i>Germany</i> and <i>Holland</i>:
For the <i>Women</i> of those <i>Countries</i> generally accustoming
themselves to some sort of active <i>Labour</i> and industrious
<i>Exercise</i>, have much easier <i>BIRTHS</i> than any <i>Others</i> that
I know.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> one general and universal <i>Reason</i> of it is,
that the <i>Bone</i> call’d <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span></em>, which is loosely
join’d to the inferiour Extremity of the <i>Bone</i> call’d
<span class='sc'>Sacrum</span>, bending outwards during the Time of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Labour</span></em>;
as the <i>CHILD</i> advances, its <i>Head</i> presseth the
<i>Gut</i> call’d <span class='sc'>Rectum</span> hard against it; which causeth most
severe, acute, and extreme <i>PAINS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>ANOTHER</em> principal and universal <i>Reason</i>
of it, is, the <span class='sc'>Bulk</span> of the <i>Head</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><i>INFANT</i></em>;
which (according to <i>Albertus Magnus</i>) is equal in the
time of <i>BIRTH</i>, to the rest of the <i>Whole Man</i>; causing
a violent <i>Dilatation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, that is very <i>strait</i> in
comparison of this <span class='sc'>Bulk</span>; and <i>That</i> being a very sensible
<i>Membranous Composition</i>, <i>This</i> must (of Necessity)
occasion most grievous and almost intolerable <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAINS</em></i>.
Whence I come to</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XLI.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>CAUSES</em> of a sooner, or later <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>MANY</em> great Men have written and answer’d
promiscuously on this <i>Head</i>, suggesting a vast
Variety of <i>Reasons</i> for it: But as <i>Every One</i> is left to
think and judge the Best he can for Himself, so I shall
(in this place) only animadvert upon <i>Those Causes</i>,
which I most entirely approve of; and as they are <i>Fivefold</i>,
so I think, they either depend upon the <i>Genital
Seed</i>; the <i>Formative Faculty</i>; the <i>Temperature</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>; the <i>Constitution</i> of the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>; or the <i>Influence</i>
of <i>Superiour Bodies</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>natural Cause</i> may depend upon the <span class='sc'>Seed</span>:
Because as there is among <span class='sc'>Grain</span> several <i>sorts</i>, some of
which fructify and ripen in <i>Three</i>, some in <i>Four Months</i>,
and others which require much <i>longer Time</i>; so it may
be also in <i>human</i> <span class='sc'>Seed</span>, that it may differ as much in
its Kind. Which Truth is very evident from what
has been frequently observed, that <i>Women</i> bring forth
the <i>Children</i> of different <span class='sc'>Fathers</span>, at different Times;
whereof I shall only mention the remarkable Instance
of <i>Vestilia</i><a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c017'><sup>[149]</sup></a>: who was thus deliver’d of <i>Three Children</i>
to her <i>Three several Husbands</i>, <span class='sc'>Herditius</span>, <span class='sc'>Pomponius</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Orsitus</span>, all noble Citizens of <i>Rome</i>: <i>viz.</i> Of the
<i>one</i> in the <i>7th</i>, of the <i>other</i> in the <i>11th</i>, and of the <i>last</i>
at the Expiration of <i>8 Months</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>natural Cause</i> may also depend upon the
<i>FORMING FACULTY</i>; so far, as the <i>Formation</i> and
<i>Perfection</i> of the <i>FOETUS</i> depend upon its <i>Strength</i> or
<i>Debility</i>: For as it may be evidently observ’d after the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span><i>BIRTH</i>, that <i>some Children</i> grow a-pace and very suddenly;
<i>others</i> (because of a <i>sickly Constitution</i>) thrive
but very little, and grow slowly; so it happens also
with the <i>FOETUS</i> in the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>: for the <i>stronger</i> that
this <i>Faculty</i> is, the sooner <i>Formation</i> is perfected, and
consequently the sooner the <em class='gesperrt'><i>BIRTH</i></em> follows successfully.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> Natural <i>Cause</i> again may depend upon the
<i>Temperature</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>: Because that the <i>Woman</i>
(being the only <i>one</i> of all Creatures which tolerates <i>Copulation</i>
during the time of <i>Pregnancy</i>) may be, by its
frequent or immoderate <i>Use</i>, disorder’d in that noble
<i>Part</i>; which may infallibly confound and pervert the
regular <span class='sc'>Time</span>. For as the <span class='sc'>Buds</span> of <i>Vines</i> cherish’d in the
Bosom of the <i>Earth</i>, may be easily cut or dissipated by
the <i>Plough</i>; so as at least to alter the <span class='sc'>Time</span> of <i>Fructification</i>,
if not quite to destroy <i>Them</i>: So it is not very
unlikely with the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> in the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; and therefore
wise <i>Nature</i> (sollicitous of <i>Propagation</i> and <i>Preservation</i>
of the <i>Human</i> <span class='sc'>Foetus</span>) will not allow that a <i>Woman</i>
should have one <i>precise Time</i> of <i>BIRTH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> Natural <i>Cause</i> may also depend upon the
<i>Constitution</i> of the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>, so far as her <i>Habits</i> of Body,
and <i>Way of Living</i>, are conducive (or <i>not</i>) to the <i>Maturation</i>,
<i>Perfection</i>, <i>Strength</i>, or <i>Debility</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> finally, the <i>Cause</i> may depend upon a
<i>superiour Influence</i>, in so far that, as we see with our
<i>Eyes</i>, such <i>Grain</i> as is <i>sowed</i>, and such <i>Plants</i> or <i>Trees</i> as
are <i>planted</i> in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Interlunium</span></i>, or <i>silent Moon</i>, and before
<i>Full-Moon</i>, to fructify and <i>ripen</i> sooner than others: Or,
as we see and perceive our very <i>Nails</i> and <i>Hair</i> which
are <i>cut</i> in that Time, to <i>grow</i> faster and sooner, than
what is so <i>cut</i> after the <i>Full-Moon</i>: So we may as
easily comprehend by our <i>Reason</i>, that these <i>Times</i>
may have the same Natural <i>Effect</i> in the<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c017'><sup>[150]</sup></a><i>Human Seed</i>.
And as then the <i>Parts</i> are more <i>Succulent</i>, and the <i>Generative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Virtue</i> more <i>excitated</i>, not only in the <i>Human
Seed</i>, but also in all other <i>Seeds</i> and <i>Roots</i>, what wonder
is it, that the <i>Womb</i> be also more <i>efficacious</i> and <i>prestant</i>
at the same <i>Conjuncture</i>?</p>

<p class='c005'>This I take to have been <i>Pliny</i>’s<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c017'><sup>[151]</sup></a> Meaning, saying
none are <i>born</i> in the 7th Month, but they who have
been <i>conceiv’d</i> in the very <i>Change</i> of the <i>Moon</i>, or within
a Day of it, under or over. Hence I may justly observe,
that all <i>slower Births</i> have been <i>begotten</i> at opposite
Times; for which, I think, I have also sufficient Authority
from<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c017'><sup>[152]</sup></a><i>HIPPOCRATES</i> himself, saying, when
a <i>Woman conceives</i> after <i>Full-Moon</i>, that <i>Conception</i> must,
of Necessity, reach the 11th Month.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HAVING</em> thus far (according to the Best of my
Judgment) dilucidated these <i>Cases</i>, and having hitherto
conducted the <i>Woman with Child</i>, and brought her safe
this Length, thro’ all the <i>Difficulties</i> she has been expos’d
to, and the many <i>Hardships</i> she has met with in
her <i>Gestation</i> or <i>Bearing-Time</i>, to the compleat <i>Number</i>
of her <i>MONTHS</i>, or precise <i>Time</i> of her <i>LABOUR</i>:
It remains now, that I should also direct her <i>Safety</i>
upon that emergent Occasion; since if we should now
lose our good and fruitful <i>Woman</i> at last, all our previous
<i>Pains</i> and <i>Care</i> have been <i>Labour in vain</i>, and nothing
but <i>Frustration</i>. But, because the <i>Work</i> of <i>DELIVERY</i>,
does not always depend upon the <i>Woman</i>
herself, and but seldom in these <i>Countries</i>, upon the
<i>Physician</i>; before I commit her to the <i>Hands</i> of the rude
or unskilful, (whether <em class='gesperrt'><i>MAN</i></em> or <em class='gesperrt'><i>WOMAN-MIDWIFE</i></em>)
I shall in the next Place, (with all due <i>Deference</i>
to my <i>SUPERIOURS</i>, especially the eminent <i>Professors</i>

of <i>LONDON</i>) endeavour to instruct such Persons in the

the necessary <i>Knowledge</i>, and indispensible <i>Duty</i> of their

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> fine, I shall attempt now to perform This <i>Undertaking</i>

<em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em>, and whatever may depend of,
take Rise from, or have any antecedent,
concomitant, or consequent Relation to
it, is the only proper Business of <span class='sc'>Midwifery</span>,
and justly deemed the common
Boundary of the <i>Knowledge</i> and <i>Practice</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Midwife</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> <i>Art</i> of <span class='sc'>Midwifery</span> is (in itself) as excellent
and ingenious, as its <i>Practice</i> is useful, and absolutely
necessary to the <i>Commonwealth</i>; insomuch that
this will admit of no <i>Contradiction</i>, when we rightly
consider the following few, but important, general
<i>Heads</i>, to which I reduce it throughout this Work, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Art</i> distinguisheth a <i>Fertile</i> from a <i>Sterile</i>
or Barren <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; it supports and corroborates the
<i>one</i>, and rectifies and cures the <i>other</i>, in most (if not in
all) <i>Cases</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>II. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> distinguisheth an impregnated from an unconceived
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, a real from a false <i>Big-Belly</i>, and a
natural from a preternatural <i>CONCEPTION</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> teacheth the <i>Regimen</i> of the conceived Woman,
for averting the Severity of the <span class='sc'>Symptoms</span> of the
several <i>Months</i>, and all acute <i>Diseases</i>, in order to
strengthen the <i>Infant</i>, and prevent any <span class='sc'>Miscarriage</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> instructeth by the <i>Touch</i> or <i>Handling</i> only,
to discover, from time to time, the true <i>State</i> and Condition
of the <i>Conceived Woman</i>, not only during the
Time of <i>Pregnancy</i>, but also before and in the time of
<span class='sc'>Labour</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> immediately (in the beginning of <span class='sc'>Labour</span>)
discriminates a <i>Natural</i> from a <i>Preternatural</i>, and an
<i>easy</i> and <i>speedy</i> from a <i>difficult</i> and <i>lingring</i> future <span class='sc'>Birth</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> presently discovers any <i>one</i> or more of
the many different, general, or particular <i>CAUSES</i> of
<i>difficult</i> or <i>preternatural</i> <span class='sc'>Births</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> informeth the fair <i>Practiser</i> how to remove
and correct those <i>CAUSES</i>, and deliver the <i>Woman</i>, not
at all by <i>butcherly Instruments</i>, but by <i>Judgment</i> and <i>Help</i>
of <span class='sc'>Hand</span> only.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> sheweth not only how to extract <i>dead
Children</i>, and sometimes <span class='sc'>Monsters</span>, but also false <i>Conceptions</i>,
<i>Superfœtations</i>, <i>Moles</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'>IX. <em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> Lastly, this <span class='sc'>Art</span> teacheth the true <i>Regimen</i>
of the <i>CHILD-BED-WOMAN</i>, and her <i>BABE</i>,
together with the proper <i>Methods</i> and <i>Means</i> of <i>HELP</i>
in all Cases incident to them <i>Both</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>Heads</i> (I think) fully comprehend the
whole <i>Art</i> of <span class='sc'>Midwifery</span>: And what can be more <i>ingenious</i>
now? What can be more <i>conducive</i> to the common
Good, or more <i>serviceable</i> to any Country, than
the Preservation of the <i>Health</i> and <i>Lives</i> of its multiplying
<i>WOMEN</i> and <i>CHILDREN</i>?</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Art</i> has been in such <i>Esteem</i> among the <i>ANTIENTS</i>,
that it was (in all Ages) the <i>Study</i> of the
most Learned <span class='sc'>Physicians</span>; tho’ its <i>Practice</i> succeeded
best only, first in <i>France</i>, then in <i>Italy</i>, and afterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>in <i>Germany</i>. For in these <i>Countrys</i> their <i>Women</i> of all
Ranks (the most Precise and Virtuous) have accustom’d
themselves (upon this Occasion) to lay aside all <i>childish
Bashfulness</i> and <i>imaginary Modesty</i>, in order to secure
their <i>Own</i> and their <i>Childrens</i> Safety, by inviting the
<i>Assistance</i> of <i>both SEXES</i>. And indeed <i>MEN</i> (whom
I may justly call the truest and best <i>Boethogynists</i>) being
better versed in <i>Anatomy</i>, better acquainted with <i>Physical
Helps</i>, and commonly endued with greater <i>Presence
of Mind</i>, have been always found readier or discreeter,
to devise something more <i>new</i>, and to give quicker <i>Relief</i>
in Cases of <i>difficult</i> or <i>preternatural BIRTHS</i>, than
common <i>MIDWIFES</i> generally understand; By which
means it comes to pass, that this <span class='sc'>Art</span> is now brought
to its greatest <i>Perfection</i> in these <i>Countries</i>: Insomuch
that, if I might be allowed to adopt a <i>new Term</i> into
our Language, instead of <i>MAN-MIDWIFE</i>, which
seems to be a Contradiction in <i>Terms</i>, I would call
him the <span class='sc'>Andro-Boethogynist</span>, or <i>Man-Helper of Woman</i>,
for his excellent Skill in <i>MIDWIFERY</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, the <i>Authors</i> of these Countries
have not been remiss, in communicating their <i>Experience</i>
and <i>Methods</i> taken to prevent and remedy the many various
<i>Difficulties</i> which have occurred in this nice Affair.
No, <i>Senertus</i>, <i>Rod. à Castro</i>, <i>Viardel</i>, <i>Mauriceau</i>,
<i>Portal</i>, <i>Daventer</i>, <i>Bartine</i>, <i>Garofanzzo</i>, <i>Pfizerus</i>, &amp;c. have
promerited our immortal <i>Praises</i> as well as <i>Thanks</i>, for
such famous and generous Instances as they have given
of their great <i>Beneficence</i> to <i>MANKIND</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Four latter</i> have made vast <i>Improvements</i> of this
<span class='sc'>Art</span>: but particularly, the most Learned, Ingenious,
and excellent <span class='sc'>Physicians</span>, and <i>Men-Midwives</i>, (as
vulgarly called) Sig. <i>Garofanzzo</i> and <i>Pfizerus</i> (my most
honoured <i>Instructors</i> in this <span class='sc'>Art</span>) have absolutely perfected
the <span class='sc'>Work</span> begun by <i>others</i>; for their Rules are
firmly founded on sound Anatomy, and their <i>Doctrines</i>
are more extensive, particular, plain, and infallible,
than all their <i>PREDECESSORS</i> Discoveries.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span><em class='gesperrt'>THEY</em> explain this <span class='fss'>ART</span> upon firm <i>Mathematical
Foundations</i>, and solid <i>Demonstrations</i> of Truth. Besides
they give many new, and most necessary <i>Directions</i>, in
regard to <i>Touching</i> or <i>Handling</i> of Women; whereby
<i>MIDWIVES</i> may not only foresee all <i>Difficulties</i>, which
can possibly happen, but also prevent them in due
Time.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THEIR</em> great <i>Ingenuity</i> and <i>Dexterity</i> in this
<i>ART</i>, has (to the Glory of <i><em class='gesperrt'>GOD</em></i> Almighty’s good
<i>Providence</i>, and the Honour of their own <i>Profession</i>)
rendred the <i>Use</i> of <span class='sc'>Instruments</span>, not only needless
and superfluous, but also odious and ridiculous. They
instruct us how to remedy the most difficult <i>Occurrences</i>,
by a right <i>Understanding</i> of the Business, and a
nice subtile skilful <i>HAND</i> only, without any manner
of other <i>INSTRUMENT</i>; excepting only in the
Case of a <i>MONSTROUS</i> or <i>dead BIRTH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> whose great <i>Authorities</i>, and the small
<i>Knowledge</i> I myself have of the <i>Parts</i> of Generation, if
I affirm the imminent and manifest <i>Danger</i> of such dilating
<span class='sc'>Instruments</span>, as are commonly us’d upon every
trifling Occasion, I hope it will not be taken amiss by
the <i>READER</i>: Since my <i>Design</i> is not so much to discourage
any in their <i>Practice</i>, as only to excite such
<i>Practitioners</i> to apply themselves to the above-mention’d
far more <i>Safe</i>, <i>Easy</i>, and <i>Commendable</i> <span class='sc'>Method</span>: which
if they shall think fit to do, the Excellency of the <i>Profession</i>
will shine as bright <i>Here</i> as in <i>other Parts</i> of the
World; and at the same time, the absurd <i>Imputations</i>
and false <i>Suggestions</i> of the Ignorant (who imagine all
<i>Women</i> to be deliver’d either by <span class='sc'>Chance</span>, or by such
barbarous <span class='sc'>Usage</span>) will be clean wip’d off: For (I am
fully satisfy’d) that our <span class='sc'>Art</span>, no ways depends upon
<span class='sc'>Chance</span> or <span class='sc'>Fortune</span>, and running any <i>Risque</i> or <i>Hazard</i>;
but (to the contrary) on as firm a <i>Foundation</i>,
and as infallible <i>Rules</i>, as a great many <i>other Professions</i>,
which however yet are sometimes subject to <i><em class='gesperrt'>ACCIDENTS</em></i>.
All which I shall endeavour to make
evidently appear, in the next <i>SECTION</i>; where I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>shall treat of the <span class='sc'>Causes</span> of <i>difficult</i> and <i>preternatural
BIRTHS</i>, together with the respective <i>Methods</i> of preventing,
correcting, or removing them effectually.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><span class='fss'>IT</span> is indeed indifferent whether <i>Men</i> or <i>Women</i>
practise this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Art</em></span>, so the <i>Practisers</i> be properly
adapted, and duly qualified for the Purpose of so great
a <span class='sc'>Work</span>. As for Instance, in <i>France</i>, <span class='sc'>Men</span> only profess

preternatural <span class='sc'>Births</span>. Wherefore, upon this Account,
I shall <i>first</i> observe and denote the <i>Qualifications</i> most
requisite and absolutely necessary for <i>WOMEN</i> practising
this <span class='sc'>Art</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> as all <i>Arts</i> and <i>Sciences</i> require <i>Instruction</i>,

themselves for, and <i>applying</i> themselves to the Performance
of this good Office. For such as <i>These</i> ought to

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THEREFORE</em>, <i>She</i> who would discreetly undertake
<span class='sc'>Midwifery</span>, ought not to begin the <i>Practice</i>
too <i>YOUNG</i>, nor continue it till grown too <i>OLD</i>: For
the <i>one</i> will want, perhaps, due <i>Experience</i>, as well as
decent <i>Gravity</i> and <i>Solidity</i>; the <i>other</i> will, peradventure,
want requisite <i>Strength</i> and <i>Vigour</i> of Body, as
well as the Free <i>Exercise</i>, and ready <i>Use</i> of her <i>Senses</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought to be no <i>weak</i>, <i>infirm</i>, or <i>diseased</i>
Person, incapable of undergoing the <i>Fatigues</i> which the
Business too often requires: Such as <i>watching Night</i> and
<i>Day</i>; turning the <i>INFANTS</i>, when in a wrong <i>Posture</i>;
or extracting them at length; which <i>Action</i> frequently
requires the full <i>Strength</i> of a strong <i>MAN</i>,
instead of a weak <i>Woman</i>. For <i>thus</i> the most learned
and excellent <i>Fabricius d’ Aquapendente</i>, testifies of himself,
that he has often been so <i>weary</i> and <i>tired</i>, that he
has been obliged to leave the Work for his <i>Assistant</i> to
finish; and as <i>Daventer</i> also (a robust Man) relates of
himself, that in the coldest Time of <i>Winter</i>, being but
thinly <i>cloathed</i>, and at a Distance from any <i>Fire</i>, his <i>Hair</i>
has been wet, and all his <i>Body</i> in a <span class='sc'>Sweat</span>, and both his
<i>Loins</i> and his <i>Limbs</i> have aked egregiously some Days after
<i>delivering</i> a Woman.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought not to be too <i>Fat</i> or <i>Gross</i>, but
especially not to have thick or fleshy <i>Hands</i> and <i>Arms</i>,
or large-<i>Bon’d Wrists</i>; which (of Necessity) must occasion
racking <i>Pains</i> to the tender <i>labouring Woman</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought not to be <i>lame</i> or <i>maim’d</i>, nor have
stiff or crooked <i>Fingers</i>, <i>Hands</i>, or <i>Arms</i>; for these <i>Parts</i>
are to be used in different <i>Manners</i> and <i>Postures</i>, even so
that the <i>Success</i> of the <span class='sc'>Labour</span> often depends upon their
<i>Readiness</i> and <i>Agility</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought not to be, <i>negatively</i> speaking, a
<i>conceiv’d</i> or <i>Child-bearing Woman</i>; because <i>This</i> may be
of bad Consequence, not only to the <i>labouring Woman</i>;
(who depends on her, for more than she’s able to <i>perform</i>,
especially in a <i>strong</i> <span class='sc'>Labour</span>) but also to the conceiv’d
<i>MIDWIFE</i> herself, and her own <i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought not to be an <i>Ignorant</i>, <i>Stupid</i>, <i>Indolent</i>,
or a <i>dull</i> Person; and especially not incapable of
conceiving Matters distinctly, or judging of Things
aright: Neither ought <i>she</i> to be a <i>Self-Indulger</i>, <i>Slothful</i>,
or <i>Lazy</i>; nor a <i>Light</i>, <i>Dissolute</i>, or <i>Daring</i> Person: <i>She</i>
ought not to be <i>inconsiderate</i>, <i>negligent</i>, or <i>forgetful</i>; nor
<i>proud</i>, <i>passionate</i>, or <i>obstinate</i>: Neither <i>peevish</i>, <i>morose</i>, or
<i>surly</i>; nor <i>fearful</i>, <i>doubtful</i>, or <i>wavering-minded</i>: neither
ought <i>she</i> to be a <i>Tipler</i> or <i>Drunkard</i>, nor a <i>Tatler</i> or
<i>Vagabond</i>, nor a <i>covetous</i>, or <i>mercenary</i> Person.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> on the <i>other Hand</i>, in the <i>Affirmative</i>, <em class='gesperrt'><i>SHE</i></em>
(<i>First</i>) ought to be a <i>Woman</i> of a good <i>middle Age</i>, of
<i>solid Parts</i>, of <i>full Experience</i>, of a <i>healthy</i>, <i>strong</i>, and <i>vigorous
Body</i>, with clever <i>small Hands</i>: Since nothing can
be more agreeable and conducive to the <i>Art</i> of <i>MIDWIFERY</i>,
than <i>slender Hands</i>, <i>long Fingers</i>, and a <i>ready
Feeling</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought to be <i>Grave</i> and <i>Considerate</i>, endued
with <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Presence of Mind</i>, in order to foresee
and prevent <i>ACCIDENTS</i>; <i>Sagacious</i> and <i>Prudent</i> in
difficult <i>Cases</i>, so as not to take <i>All</i> upon her own Shoulders
or <i>Judgment</i>, but to have immediate <i>Recourse</i> to the
ablest <i>Practiser</i> in the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Art</span></em>, and freely submit her
<i>Thoughts</i> to the discerning <i>Faculty</i> of the more Learned
and Skilful.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought to be <i>Watchful</i>, <i>Diligent</i>, and <i>Expert</i>
in all Cases and Conditions that can or may occur;
so that no <i>Opportunity</i> in the Beginning of the <span class='sc'>Labour</span>
be lost: Since I have more than once observ’d, that the
<i>Neglect</i> or <i>Mistake</i> of improving a <i>critical</i> <span class='sc'>Minute</span>, hath
cost the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Mother</span></em> many violent or heavy <i>Pains</i> afterwards,
and the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Child</span></em> also its <i>Life</i>. For which
Reason it is of the greatest <i>Importance</i>, to nick the
<i>Opportunity</i>, conformable to <i>Cato</i>’s Saying——</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought to be a true <i>Fearer</i> of <span class='sc'>God</span>, a
<i>Conscientious</i> Person, of good <i>Life</i> and <i>Conversation</i>: Since
Matters of the greatest <i>Moment</i> are committed to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span><i>Care</i>; and depend entirely upon the faithful <i>Discharge</i> of
her Duty: For <i>she</i> has the first and best <i>Opportunity</i> of
shewing her <i>Compassion</i>, and <i>Tenderness</i> to Mankind, in
this <i>Infant</i> and <i>Helpless State</i>. In short, <span class='sc'>Charity</span> ought
always to engage her, to be as ready to help the <i>Poor</i> as
the <i>Rich</i>; the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Life</span></em> of the <i>One</i> being as Dear as the
<i>Other’s</i>, and the <i>Image</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> being equally stamp’d
upon <i>Both</i>: For the ineffable <i>Recompence</i> of <span class='sc'>Charity</span> far
exceeds all other <i>Considerations</i> of trifling <span class='sc'>Gain</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> ought to be <i>Patient</i> and <i>Pleasant</i>; <i>Soft</i>,
<i>Meek</i>, and <i>Mild</i> in her <i>Temper</i>, in order to encourage
and comfort the <i>labouring Woman</i>. <span class='sc'>She</span> should pass by
and forgive her small <i>Failings</i>, and peevish <i>Faults</i>, instructing
her gently when she <i>does</i> or says <i>amiss</i>: But
if she will not follow <i>Advice</i>, and Necessity require,
the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> ought to reprimand and put her smartly
in mind of her <i>Duty</i>; yet always in such a manner,
however, as to encourage her with the <i>Hopes</i> of a happy
and speedy <span class='sc'>Delivery</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> like manner as she ought to be <i>Modest</i>, <i>Temperate</i>,
and <i>Sober</i>, so she ought to be <i>Faithful</i> and <i>Silent</i>;
always upon her <i>Guard</i> to conceal those Things, which
ought not to be spoken of.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em>, in fine, are the chief of the natural <i>Qualities</i>
requisite for <i>MIDWIFERY</i>; from whence I come
to the <i>Theoretical</i> and <i>Practical Part</i>, without which all
<i>Others</i> are (in effect) Nothing to the Purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> III.</span><br /> <i>Of the THEORETICAL and PRACTICAL Knowledge of the <em class='gesperrt'>MIDWIFE</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em>, who finds herself thus (properly) adapted
both in <i>Body</i> and <i>Mind</i>, according to the <i>Rules</i> of
the preceding <i>Chapter</i>, does a Good and Laudable Work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>if she also studies to <i>qualify</i> herself well, <i>first</i> in the
<i>THEORY</i>, and then in the <i>PRACTICE</i> of <i>Midwifery</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em>, in order that she may most easily and
accurately do, I shall reduce the whole <i>Theoretical Part</i>
(absolutely necessary) to the following <i>Seven general
Heads</i>; of Which she ought not only to have a general
and superficial, but also a distinct, special, and perfect
<i>Knowledge</i>; viz.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>OF</em> the <i>external</i> and <i>internal Parts</i> of Generation,
and the <i>adjacent Parts</i>; together with a competent
Skill of the respective <i>Substance</i> and <i>Nature</i>, <i>Connexion</i>
and <i>Function</i> of each of <i>These</i> in the Time of <i>BIRTH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <span class='fss'>OF</span> the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, or <i>Bason</i>, and its <i>Contents</i>; together
with the true Knowledge of its <i>Bones</i>, their
<i>Form</i> or <i>Figure</i>, <i>Office</i> and <i>Connexion</i>, &amp;c. upon that
Occasion.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>OF</em> that Wonderful <i>Body</i>, the <span class='sc'>Matrix</span>, and its
<i>Vagina</i> or <i>Neck</i>; together with the understanding of
its <i>Substance</i> and <i>Structure</i>, <i>Duty</i> and <i>Function</i> in Time of
<span class='sc'>Labour</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>OF</em> the Strange Natural <i>Qualities</i>, and amazing
singular <i>Faculties</i> of This <i>Body</i>, in distinguishing all its
peculiar <i>Properties</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>OF</em> the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, or <i>Handling</i> the <i>Woman</i>; together
with knowing its many various <i>Uses</i>, and manifold
distinct <i>Advantages</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>OF</em> the <i>Genuine</i>, and <i>Real</i>; as well as of the
<i>Spurious</i> or <i>Bastard-Labour-Pains</i>: How they differ in
themselves, and are to be carefully distinguished.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. <em class='gesperrt'>OF</em> the <i>Method</i> of <span class='sc'>Laying</span> the <i>Woman</i>, and
<i>Manner</i> of extracting the <span class='sc'>After-Birth</span>; together with
all the <i>heterogeneous</i> and <i>preternatural Contents</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>speculative Heads</i>, in short, shall be the
particular <i>Subjects</i> of the respective <i>Chapters</i>, of the
consequent Part of this <span class='sc'>Section</span>, for the requisite <i>Instruction</i>
and indispensible <i>Qualification</i> of all young
<i>MIDWIVES</i>: As the <i>Practical Part</i> shall be the <i>Subject-Matter</i>
of the two next following <span class='sc'>Sections</span>. Which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span><i>Practical Part</i>, I shall now likewise reduce to the <i>Three</i>
subsequent general <i>Heads</i>; of which she ought also to
have a full and compleat <i>Knowledge</i>, viz.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>OF</em> the various <i>Methods</i> to be taken for the present
<i>Ease</i>, and expeditious <i>Relief</i> of the <span class='sc'>Labouring</span>
<i>Woman</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>OF</em> the discreet <i>Method</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Turning</span></em> an ill-situated
<i>INFANT</i>, (whatsoever the preternatural <i>Posture</i>
may be) and drawing it forth <i>safely</i> by the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>OF</em> Her own personal <i>Duty</i> (as <i>MIDWIFE</i>)
both to the <i>MOTHER</i> and the <i>CHILD</i> after <i>Delivery</i>;
as also towards all <i>Labouring Women</i>, to whom she may
be call’d, upon <i>critical Conjunctures</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> I call <i>practical Heads</i>, because they depend
more upon <i>Practice</i> and <i>Experience</i>, or <i>Judgment</i>
and <i>Charity</i>, than upon any <i>fundamental Rules</i>; which
however yet ought also to be reckon’d <i>Branches</i> of her
<i>THEORY</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> notwithstanding all these natural and acquir’d
<i>Qualifications</i>, the <i>young MIDWIFE</i> is not to
run at once into the <i>Practice</i>: Nor to hurry herself
rashly to lay <i>Hands</i> upon the <i>ARK</i>, before she is thoroughly
well accomplished for so sacred a <i>Work</i>; lest
(like <i>Uzzah</i>) <i>she</i> be punished for her <i>Temerity</i>; whereof
I have seen several exemplary <i>Precedents</i>. No, the <i>Work</i>
is too important, and the <i>Concern</i> too weighty for that
hasty indiscreet <i>Undertaking</i>; for there is no less than the
<i>Life</i> of the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>, and <i>one</i> <span class='sc'>Child</span> at least, (if not
sometimes <i>more</i>) at <i>Stake</i>: Both which may be soon
saved, or quickly lost, according to the Good or Bad
<i>Conduct</i> and <i>Management</i> of the <i>MIDWIFE</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em>, to the End, that she may
obtain the necessary <i>Experience</i>, and perfect her Judgment,
<i>&amp;c.</i> in due Course, she ought to satisfy herself
at first to go (for some time) as an <i>Assistant</i> to some <i>skilful
Woman</i> of good Business, and so by degrees advance
herself into the <i>Practice</i>: Because <i>Dexterity</i> in this <i>ART</i>,
is only acquir’d by <i>Time</i> and <i>Exercise</i>; the <i>practical
Part</i> of <i>MIDWIFERY</i> being attended with so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>complicated Circumstances of <i>accidental Difficulties</i>, that
it is almost impossible for any Persons, who never apply’d
themselves this way, to believe how much it
differs from all the <i>THEORY</i>, that the most ingenious
<i>MAN</i> can make himself <i>Master</i> of.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>I SHALL</em> only (in this place) farther explain,
what I mean, by the <i>MIDWIFE</i>’s <i>Duty</i> to all <i>Women</i>
in <i>LABOUR</i>, to whom she may be call’d upon <i>critical
Conjunctures</i>; as the latter part of the above-mentioned
last General <i>Head</i> purports: namely this, That the <i>MIDWIFE</i>,
in the Course of her <i>Practice</i>, ought always to
observe carefully, and follow strictly the <i>Rules</i> of <i>EQUITY</i>
and <i>CHARITY</i>: That is, supposing the <i>MIDWIFE</i>
to be sent for by a Person in <span class='sc'>Labour</span>, whose <i>Case</i> is Natural
and all Things likely to go well; and in the mean
time, after she has taken her in Hand, is peradventure
sent for to <i>another Woman</i>, whose difficult or preternatural
<i>Case</i> threatens imminent <i>Danger</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this <i>Case</i>, the <i>MIDWIFE</i> knowing herself to be
better qualified than <i>Others</i>, and that <i>Another</i> not equally
expert is able to lay the <i>Former</i>, she ought to attend
and assist the <i>Latter</i>: And <i>That</i> also notwithstanding the
<i>First</i> be <span class='sc'>Rich</span>, and the <i>Latter</i>, <span class='sc'>Poor</span>; since <i>GOD</i> is no
<i>Respecter of Persons</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em>, if it happen, that <i>one Rich</i>, and <i>another poor
Woman</i>, want <span class='sc'>Help</span> both at a time, and are in equal
Danger: In <i>that Case</i>, without any regard to the <i>one’s
WEALTH</i>, or the <i>other’s POVERTY</i>; the <i>MIDWIFE</i>
is to assist <i>Her</i> first, whom <i>Divine Providence</i> first
call’d her to, or first engag’d her withal. And as the
<i>Cases</i> of <i>Women</i> in <span class='sc'>Labour</span> may differ, so she ought impartially
to act and dispose of herself; having always
an Eye to something <i>superiour</i> to, and far above that of
mean <span class='sc'>Lucre</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> IV.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>QUALIFICATIONS</em> of the Extraordinary <em class='gesperrt'>MIDWIFE</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Extraordinary MIDWIFE</i>, or <i>Andro-Boethogynist</i>
(whether <i>Physician</i> or <i>Surgeon</i> practicing this
<span class='sc'>Art</span>) ought not only to be endued with all the <i>Qualities</i>
and <i>Qualifications</i> mentioned in the <i>Two</i> preceding
<i>Chapters</i>, but also to excel the <span class='sc'>Woman-Midwife</span> in
many special <i>Particulars</i>, and ingenious <i>Points</i>; which
no ways belong to her <i>Female Province</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> it is not enough that He knows how to relieve
and <i>lay</i> the <i>labouring Woman</i>, however difficult or
preternatural her <i>Case</i> may be; nor is it sufficient that
he understands how to <i>help</i> and succour both the <i>MOTHER</i>
and the <i>INFANT</i> after such a <i>Delivery</i>: No, so
much of his Business might be easily learn’d and enhanced
by <i>old Women</i>, were they but <i>Docile</i>, and not
such obstinate <i>Creatures</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> <i>He</i> ought farther also to know (<i>first</i>) how to
prevent all preternatural <i>Disasters</i> incident to both the <i>one</i>
and the <i>other</i>, in their respective <i>States</i> of <span class='sc'>Child-Bed</span> and
<span class='sc'>Infancy</span>: And, <i>Secondly</i>, how to administer Relief and
perform the <span class='sc'>Cure</span>, in <i>Case</i> of any dismal <i>Accident</i> whatsoever
to <i>one</i> or <i>either</i> of them in their dangerous Condition.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, his <i>Knowledge</i> ought neither to
commence nor terminate in these Things; it being also
his <i>Duty</i> over and above to know, how to conduct
the <i>Woman</i> safely through all the <i>Months</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><i>GESTATION</i></em>,
and to avert from her the <i>Severity</i> of their respective
<i>SYMPTOMS</i>, to which she is so much expos’d,
as mentioned in their proper <i>Chapters</i>, <span class='sc'>Sect.</span> III. And
not only so neither, but He ought also to understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>well, how to guard against the <span class='sc'>Accesses</span> of all <i>Acute
Diseases</i>, so as at least to avert their ill <i>Consequences</i>; and
especially (of course) to know thoroughly how to prevent
<i>ABORTION</i> itself.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> are the <i>Cases</i> which most commonly require
the ingenious Assistance of the <i>Extraordinary
MIDWIFE</i>: And <i>These</i> are they which try his <i>Skill</i>
and <i>Knowledge</i> most, as the <i>Tempest</i> or <i>Storm</i> best discovers
the <i>Judgment</i> and <i>Capacity</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Master</em>-Mariner</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> yet, neither ought even <i>these Limits</i> to be the
narrow <i>Boundary</i> of his <span class='sc'>Studies</span>: Since the more extensive
his <span class='sc'>Art</span> and <i>Knowledge</i> is, especially in what relates
to the <i>natural Constitution</i> of <span class='sc'>Women</span>, the <i>fitter
Man</i> He is to take upon himself the <i>Practice</i> of this
noble and most ingenious <i>Profession</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOT</em> that I would be thought tacitely to insinuate
in this place by the By, as if my own <i>Knowledge</i> was
in any degree <span class='sc'>Superiour</span> to <i>other Men’s</i>: No, I am too
sensible of my own <i>Weakness</i>, to mean so, or to entertain
any such vain selfish Thought; neither have I any
fond <i>Ambition</i> to aim at standing in <i>Competition</i> with
<i>others</i> in these Respects. For it shall suffice me, and
sufficiently gratify my Highest <i>Aim</i>, if possibly a simple
Word may drop from my <i>Pen</i>, which the more Ingenious
may sometime improve to the common Good of
<i>Women</i>, and the Welfare of their <i>Children</i>: And this I
would desire the more, because I know no larger
<i>FIELD</i>, that the <i>Learned</i> can launch out into; nor any
profounder <i>Study</i>, that they can descant upon, than the
<i>Nature</i> and <i>Constitution</i> of this tender <span class='sc'>Sex</span>, which is so
peculiarly different from all other <i>Natural Works</i>, and
so singularly discrepant from all other <i>Created Beings</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> more particularly in order, that the <i>MAN-MIDWIFE</i>
or <i>Andro-Boethogynist</i> may be thus duly qualify’d
and completely accomplished;</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> ought not only to be liberally <i>instructed</i> and
generously <i>educated</i>, but also to be a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Man</span></em> of good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span><i>Breeding</i> and <i>Conversation</i>, as well as <i>Courtesy</i> and <i>Complaisance</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> ought not only to be a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Man</span></em> of diligent
<i>Study</i> and sedulous <i>Application</i> of Mind, but also of
great <i>Humanity</i> and <i>Integrity</i>, <i>Temperance</i> and <i>Sobriety</i>,
endued with solid <i>Resolution</i>, quick <i>Apprehension</i>, and
great <i>Presence</i> of Mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> ought not only to be a <span class='sc'>Man</span> of <i>strict Virtue</i>
and <i>Chastity</i>, but also of unspotted <i>Life</i> and <i>Conversation</i>,
<i>Charity</i> and <i>Companion</i>; delighting in <i>Hospitality</i>,
and doing <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Good</span></em>; acting the <i>Christian</i> as well as the
<i>Gentleman</i> in all respects.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> ought not only to be a Man of known
<i>Discretion</i> and <i>Secresy</i>, <i>Sagacity</i> and <i>Judgment</i>, but also
of a pleasant <i>Countenance</i>; neat and clean in <i>Person</i>
and <i>Cloathes</i>, Agreeable and Decent in <i>Words</i> and
<i>Actions</i>, carefully adverting (at all times) to give no
Occasion of <i>Shame</i> or <i>Confusion</i> to the <i>Labouring Woman</i>,
or the <i>By-standers</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>HE</em> ought, in fine, to <i>handle</i> Her <i>decently</i>, and
treat her <i>gently</i>; considering <i>Her</i> as the <i>weaker Vessel</i>,
whose elegant tender <span class='sc'>Body</span>, will admit of no <i>rough
Usage</i>: Wherefore upon this Account it is, that I would
have all <i>Practitioners</i> whatsoever in this <span class='sc'>Art</span>, debarr’d
from the <i>Use</i> of <i>INSTRUMENTS</i>, which would secure
many a <span class='sc'>Mother</span> from being wounded or mangled,
and many an <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Infant</span></em> from being cut or torn to
Pieces.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOT</em> that I would be thought for all that to imitate
Mr. <i>Mauriceau</i>, saying of himself (in some Passages of
his <i>Book</i> of <i>MIDWIFERY</i>) that <i>he differs from all others</i>:
No, far from it; For I have the <i>Indisputable Authority</i>
of the most Learned and Polite <i>Practisers</i> on my side, as
mention’d before in <i>Chap.</i> 1. of this <i>SECTION</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet, I do not deny, but that <i>INSTRUMENTS</i>
have been universally used, till of late
Years; but the reason of That is Plain: Because in former
Times, <span class='sc'>Men</span> were only call’d upon <i>extraordinary
Occasions</i>; some of which (however Skilful and Ingenious)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>had not the Opportunity of <i>Laying a Woman</i> perhaps
in many Months. For which Reason it could not be
otherways, but that they must have been at a loss in
not understanding thoroughly the <i>Practical Part</i>, having
so few Opportunities of improving <i>manual Operation</i>:
Whereas since the <i>Politer Part</i> of the World has call’d
them generally to the ordinary and common <i>Practice</i> of
this <em class='gesperrt'><i>ART</i></em>; they have advanced their <i>Dexterity</i> by
degrees, and are now come to the length of discharging
that <i>Office</i> by <i>Slight of Hand</i> only, which formerly required
so many <i>frightful INSTRUMENTS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I may well indeed say <i>frightful</i>; for what can be
more inconsistent with the tender <i>NATURE</i> of <i>Women</i>,
or more <i>terrible</i> to them, than to see <span class='sc'>Men</span> come <i>armed</i>
against <i>Themselves</i> and their <i>tenderer <em class='gesperrt'>INFANTS</em></i>, with
<i>Knives</i>, <i>Hooks</i>, <i>Iron-Forceps</i>, &amp;c. thereby (as it were) to <i>help</i>
them in time of their extremest <i>Agony</i>? For my part, I am
Positive, that let who will use <i>INSTRUMENTS</i>, they
<i>kill</i> many more <em class='gesperrt'><i>INFANTS</i></em> than they <i>save</i>, and <i>ruin</i>
many more <i>WOMEN</i> than they <i>deliver</i> fairly: And
this, I think, will be easily agreed to, by all those who
have any Knowledge of the <i>Parts</i> of <i>Generation</i> in that
<span class='sc'>Sex</span>; as (I believe) it is also sufficiently evident even
to <i>Those</i> who have no <i>Judgment</i> that way, by the
notorious <i>Fatalities</i> and tragical <i>Events</i> they daily hear
of in Fact.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> I know, some <i>Chirurgeon-Practitioners</i> are
too much acquainted with the <i>Use</i> of <i>INSTRUMENTS</i>,
to lay them aside; no, they do not (it may be) think
themselves in their <i>Duty</i>, or proper <i>Office</i>, if they have
not their cruel <i>Accoutrements</i> in Hand: And what is most
unaccountable and unbecoming a <i>Christian</i>, is that, when
they have perhaps wounded the <i>MOTHER</i>, kill’d the
<i>INFANT</i>, and with violent <i>Torture</i> and inexpressible <i>Pain</i>,
drawn it out by <i>Piece-meal</i>, they think no <i>Reward</i> sufficient
for such an extraordinary Piece of mangled Work.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em>, in short, I would advise such to practise
<i>Butchery</i> rather than <i>MIDWIFERY</i>; for in <i>that Case</i>,
they could <i>sell</i> what they <i>slay</i>; but in <i>this</i>, by <i>handling</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span><span class='sc'>Man</span> so, they only bring <i>Infamy</i> upon their <i>Profession</i>,
and expose it to the <i>Contempt</i> and <i>Hatred</i> of <span class='sc'>Others</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>COVETOUSNESS</em> is the blackest of <i>Vices</i>,
and in this <i>Case</i> (I am sure) it is an unpardonable <span class='sc'>Sin</span>,
to thirst after sordid <i>Lucre</i> for procuring the <i>Health</i> or
preserving the <i>Life</i> of our Neighbour; as, I doubt, is
but too common among some mercenary People: Who
(as we have been creditably inform’d) have refus’d to
take <i>Women</i> in Hand at the very Point of Extremity or
Time of Need, before a certain <span class='sc'>Sum</span> of <i>Money</i> was first
deposited; tho’ perhaps borrow’d upon <i>Pledge</i>, or collected
amongst their charitable <i>Neighbours</i> for <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God’s</span></em>sake.</p>

<p class='c005'>I do not say however, but that the <i>Workman</i> is worthy
of his <i>Reward</i>, and <i>That</i> which ought to be paid
according to the <i>Merit</i> and <i>Dignity</i> of his Performance;
not according to the <i>Time</i> he spends about it, as hired
<i>Labourers</i> are paid their <span class='sc'>Wages</span>: No, that fruitless <i>Labour</i>
would not be worth while; no <i>Gentleman</i> would
undertake <span class='sc'>Midwifery</span> upon such unprofitable <i>Terms</i>:
For as it is in his Power to save the <i>Life</i> of the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>,
or the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, or <i>Both</i>, (which he often does effectually)
<i>He</i> undoubtedly deserves an extraordinary <i>Recompence</i>
worthy of so great and good a <span class='sc'>Piece</span> of <span class='sc'>Service</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> notwithstanding all This, an extravagant
<i>Price</i> is not to be arbitrarily demanded, nor ought the
Reward to exceed the <i>Ability</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i>;
neither are <i>Those</i> to be forsaken or left destitute of <i>Help</i>,
and expos’d to imminent <i>Danger</i>, at all Hazards of
<i>Life</i>, who cannot afford us <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Money</span></em>: But rather (on
the contrary) they are to be forthwith taken in Hand
chearfully, attended by Night or Day diligently,
and a trifle of <span class='sc'>Money</span> <i>given</i> (by us) rather than <i>taken</i> from
them, when our <i>Fellow-Christian</i>’s Circumstances so require
it. For <i>this</i> is the right way to secure <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God’s</span></em>
<i>Blessing</i> to <i>Ourselves</i>, and <i>Success</i> to all our <i>Endeavours</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em>, in short, I humbly pray, that <span class='sc'>He</span> may (out
of his infinite <i>Goodness</i> and <i>Mercy</i>) always enable <span class='sc'>Me</span>,
according to my best Inclinations, faithfully to perform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>these good <i>Offices</i>, which I know to be so much my
indispensible and incumbent <i>Duty</i>, in that <i>STATION</i>,
his All-wise <i>Providence</i> hath allotted me, as to the Affairs
of <span class='sc'>Life</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHENCE</em> I come, in the next Place, by due
Order, to treat particularly of the <i>Contents</i> of the preceding

following.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> V.</span><br /> <i>Of the External Parts of GENERATION.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>Parts</i> are generally so well known, that
I would not so much as mention them, out of
<i>Modesty</i>, were it not, that, I presume, the <i>young MIDWIFE</i>
may find something in the ensuing <i>Description</i>
worth her singular <i>Notice</i>; which however, I shall not
so much insist upon: But succinctly——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BEGINNING</em> with the <i>First</i>, call’d the <span class='sc'>Vulva</span>
or <span class='sc'>Pudendum</span>; we find it situated below the <span class='sc'>Os
Pubis</span>, having a great <i>Chink</i> or <i>Fissure</i> in the <i>Middle</i>, as
it has the <span class='sc'>Frænulum</span> and <span class='sc'>Perinæum</span> in the <i>lower Part</i>.
And above the <i>Chink</i> there is a little <i>Protuberance</i> occasioned
by <i>Fat</i> under the Skin, call’d <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mons Veneris</span></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> two <span class='sc'>Labia Vulvæ</span> being a little separated,
the <span class='sc'>Nymphæ</span> appear, join’d one to each interior Side of
them: <i>They</i> are two small Pieces of red <i>Membranous
Flesh</i>, much resembling <i>Pullet’s Gills</i>: <i>They</i> encrease
the Pleasure of <i>Copulation</i>, and direct the Course of the
<i>Urine</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the upper Part of the <i>Chink</i>, next to the <span class='sc'>Os
Pubis</span>, are several little round <i>Substances</i>; which the
most ingenious <i>Fallopius</i> call’d the <span class='sc'>Clitoris</span>, almost hid
under the <i>Skin</i> denominated the <span class='sc'>Præputium</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>A little deeper, or straight below the <span class='sc'>Clitoris</span>, is
the <span class='sc'>Urethra</span>, or <i>Orifice</i> of the Neck of the Bladder;
being a little <i>Hole</i> as big as a <i>Goose-Quill</i>; which discovers
itself by a small Eminence, and is about two
<i>Inches long</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BETWIXT</em> the <i>Muscle</i>, call’d <span class='sc'>Sphincter Urethræ</span>,
and the inner <i>Membrane</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Vagina</span></em>, are several
small <i>Glands</i>; whose excretory <i>Ducts</i> are the <i>Holes</i>
observable about the <i>URETHRA</i>, call’d<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c017'><sup>[153]</sup></a><i>LACUNÆ
GRAFFI</i>; which discharge a <i>Liquor</i> for lubricating or
making the <span class='sc'>Vagina</span> slippery, and encreasing the <i>Venereal
Titillation</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Vagina</span>, there is a slender
subtile <i>Membrane</i> situated a-cross, which is call’d the
<span class='sc'>Hymen</span>, of a different <i>Form</i> in different <i>Women</i>; being
sometimes <i>Annular</i>, and sometimes <i>Semilunar</i>: It is almost
always to be found in <i>young Girls</i>, having a small
<i>Hole</i> into the <span class='sc'>Vagina</span>; which <i>Hole</i> in <span class='sc'>Adults</span> is somewhat
larger. In the first <i>Act</i> of <i>COPULATION</i> this
<i>Membrane</i> is torn, which generally occasions an Effusion
of a little <i>Blood</i>; but this may also happen by
many other <i>Procatarctick Causes</i><a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c017'><sup>[154]</sup></a>, and accidental Occasions.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>GLANDULÆ</i> or <i>CARUNCULÆ Myrtiformes</i>
are constituted of the contracted <i>Fibres</i> of the dilacerated
<i>HYMEN</i>; and are situated on the Side opposite
to the <i>URETHRA</i>, next the <i>ANUS</i>, in the <i>FOSSA
Magna</i>, or <i>Navicularis</i>; being the same Place where
the <i>HYMEN</i> was at first established. <i>These</i> are small
fleshy <i>Eminences</i>, and are sometimes <i>Two</i> or <i>Three</i>, and
sometimes <i>Four</i> or <i>Five</i> in Number: <i>They</i> are deficient
in <i>GIRLS</i>, and <i>defaced</i> in <i>those WOMEN</i> who have had
<i>CHILDREN</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <em class='gesperrt'><i>VAGINA</i></em> or <i>Neck</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, is a long
and round <i>Canal</i>, reaching from these <i>Caruncles</i> to the
<i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; not very unlike a <i>strong small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Gut</i>: Its <i>Orifice</i> is narrow in <i>Virgins</i>, and in <i>All</i> Women
much narrower than its <i>other</i> Parts: It’s <i>Substance</i>
(according to <i>Ruysche</i>’s Observations) is <i>membranous</i>,
<i>nervous</i>, <i>papillary</i>, and <i>wrinkled</i> <span class='sc'>Within</span>; which consequently
must be of an <i>exquisitive</i> <span class='sc'>Sense</span>: In <i>Virgins</i> the
<i>WRINKLES</i> are very <i>Large</i>, especially in the <i>Fore-Part</i>;
but after frequent <i>Embraces</i> they are <i>Less</i>, and
after repeated <i>BIRTHS</i>, they entirely <i>disappear</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>VAGINA</i> lies betwixt the <i>Bladder</i> and the
<i>strait Gut</i>, or <span class='sc'>Rectum</span>; with which last it is wrapt up
in the same common <i>Membrane</i>, from the <i>PERITONÆUM</i>,
adhering to it, all its <i>Length upwards</i>, from its
<i>Orifice</i> to that of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and quite round on the
<i>lower Side</i>, as it does to the Neck of the <em class='gesperrt'><i>BLADDER</i></em>
<i>above</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> <span class='sc'>Maids</span>, the <em class='gesperrt'><i>VAGINA</i></em> is about Five Inches
<i>Long</i>, and one and a half <i>Wide</i>: But in <em class='gesperrt'><i>CHILD-BEARING-WOMEN</i></em>,
it cannot be determin’d;
because it <i>lengthens</i> in the time of <i>PREGNANCY</i>, and
<i>dilates</i> in time of <i>BIRTH</i>; having likewise (in all) some
little <i>Holes</i> or <i>Ducts</i> in it, which discharge a <i>mucous Liquor</i>.
The <i>VAGINA</i> Serves also, in fine, for a necessary
<i>Conduit</i> to the <i>MENSTRUA</i> and <i>LOCHIA</i>, as it does
for a proper <i>Passage</i> to the <i>INFANT</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> are, in short, all the <i>external Parts</i> of
<i>GENERATION</i> in <i>Women</i>; and <i>these</i> have all their
proper respective <i>Functions</i> assign’d them by <span class='sc'>Nature</span>;
contributing conjunctly and severally to the <i>Charms</i> of
<i>COPULATION</i>: Which <i>ACTION</i> alters the very <i>Course</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, and <i>Motion</i> of the <i>Animal SPIRITS</i>; and
consequently sets all the describ’d <i>Parts</i> in full <i>AGITATION</i>.
Namely, thus</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Labia</span></em> dilate: the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Orifice</span></em> swells: the
<span class='sc'>Nymphæ</span> give way: the <span class='sc'>Clitoris</span> (of exquisite Sensibility)
erects: The <span class='sc'>Glands</span> (by a <i>Protuberancy</i> of the
Parts) yield their <i>succous Contents</i>: The <span class='sc'>Vagina</span> draws
close: The <i>Fibres</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> complicate to open its
<i>Orifice</i>: The <i>Branches</i> of the <i>Spermatick</i> <span class='sc'>Artery</span> contract
to draw the Extremities of the <i>Tubes</i> to the <i>OVARIA</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>as they carry the <span class='sc'>Seed</span> to them: The <span class='sc'>Seed</span> circulating
in the <i>Veins</i>, which open in the <i>Cavity</i> of the <i>VAGINA</i>
and <i>MATRIX</i>, it ferments immediately with the <i>Mass
of Blood</i>: This <i>Fermentation</i> swells the <i>Membranes</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Tubes</span>, opens the <i>Cavity</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and disposes
<i>All</i> perfectly for the right Reception of the <i>impregnated</i>
<span class='sc'>Egg</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> hence we may plainly see, in what a miraculous
<i>Order</i> and <i>Manner</i>, all <i>These Parts</i> minister, and
are subservient unto that (yet more) admirable and
wonderful <i>Body</i> the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>. Which being thus in brief
<i>anatomically</i> described, I come next in Course to</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>
<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_186.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VI.</span><br /> <i>Of the Internal Parts of GENERATION.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> discoursing of <i>These</i>, I shall begin with the chief
<i>Part</i>, to which the rest are but <i>Subservients</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><i>FIRST</i></em> then, the <i>MATRIX</i> or <i>Womb</i>, is situated
in the upper Part of the Cavity of the <i>PELVIS</i>, or <i>Bason</i>,
between the <i>Bladder</i> and <i>Streight Gut</i>. It is placed
there in the Middle of the <i>HYPOGASTRIUM</i>, for the
Convenience of <span class='sc'>Copulation</span>, and the more easy and
ready <i>Extrusion</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><i>SECONDLY</i></em>, The <i>Bones</i> of the <i>PELVIS</i> (as described
hereafter below) stand as a <i>Rampart</i>, fencing it
against all external <i>Injuries</i>; That is to say, the <i>OS
PUBIS</i> protects it <i>before</i>; the <i>SACRUM behind</i>; and
the <i>ILIUM</i> on <i>each Side</i>: Like as the <i>BLADDER</i> and
<i>RECTUM</i> on the other Hand defend this Noble <i>Part</i>
again from the <i>Rigidity</i> of these <span class='sc'>Bones</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><i>THIRDLY</i></em>, the <i>Figure</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, from its internal
<i>Orifice</i> to its Bottom, in a <i>Natural State</i>, resembles
a large compress’d <i>PEAR</i>. Its <i>Length</i> is about
three Inches; its <i>Breadth</i> two in the <i>Hinder</i>, and one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>in the <i>Fore-Part</i>; its <i>Thickness</i> half an Inch large: But
I take the <i>Dimensions</i> of it, in general, to differ accord-to
the <i>Age</i> and <i>Constitution</i> of the <span class='sc'>Body</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> <i>MAIDS</i> however its <i>Cavity</i> is much <i>less</i>, and
can scarcely contain the Bigness of a <span class='sc'>Bean</span>: whereas
in <i>Women with Child</i>, the <i>Dimensions</i> and <i>Figure</i>, as well
as the <i>Cavity</i> itself differs, according to the different
<i>Times</i> of <i>GESTATION</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> I have said before, its <i>Anterior Part</i> coheres <i>above</i>
with the <i>BLADDER</i>, <i>below</i> with the <i>RECTUM</i>; the
<i>Hinder Part</i> being free: But the <i>lateral Parts</i> are tied
by <i>Four Ligaments</i> of different Sorts; whereof <i>Two</i> are
placed <i>Above</i>, and <i>Two Below</i>; the <i>Superiors</i> are called
<span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ligamenta Lata</span></span>, or broad; the <i>Inferiors</i> <span class='sc'>Rotunda</span>, or
round <i>Ligaments</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>two broad Ligaments</i> are <i>Membranous</i>, and call’d
<span class='sc'>Alæ Vespertilionum</span>; which spring from the <span class='sc'>Peritonæum</span>,
and join the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> on each Side to the <i>OSSA
ILIA</i>: So that the <i>OVARIA</i> are fasten’d to <i>one End</i> of
them, and the <span class='sc'>Tubæ</span> <i>Fallopianæ</i> lie along the <i>Other</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>two round Ligaments</i> arise from the <i>Fore</i> and
<i>lateral Part</i> of the Bottom of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and pass thro’
the Rings of the <i>Muscles</i> of the <span class='sc'>Abdomen</span>, terminating
in <i>Fat</i> near the <span class='sc'>Groins</span>. <i>They</i> are of a hard <i>Substance</i>,
pretty <i>Big</i> at the Bottom of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; but <i>smaller</i> and
<i>flatter</i>, as they approach the <i>OS PUBIS</i>. Now Those
<i>Four Ligaments</i> serve to keep the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> streight, steady,
and firm in its proper Place <i>before BIRTH</i>, and to restore
it to its natural <i>Position</i>, by the Help of <span class='sc'>Contraction</span>,
<i>After</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> opening into the <i>VAGINA</i>,
is of the same <i>Figure</i> with the <i>Nut</i> of the <i>PENIS</i>:
This in <i>VIRGINS</i> is very <i>small</i>, scarcely admitting a
<i>Specillum</i> or <i>Probe</i>; in <span class='sc'>Others</span> it is much <i>larger</i>; but
in <i>Women with Child</i>, several small <i>Ducts</i> or Vesicles
open among the <span class='sc'>Rugæ</span>, which discharge a <i>Glutinous
Liquor</i> to close and seal up this <i>Orifice</i>, till the Time of
<i>BIRTH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Substance</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is <i>Solid</i> and <i>Muscular</i>,
composed of a various <span class='sc'>Plexus</span>, or Web of fleshy <i>Fibres</i>,
woven like a <span class='sc'>Net</span>, with the Interposition of innumerable
<i>Vessels</i>, of <i>ARTERIES</i>, <i>VEINS</i>, <i>NERVES</i>, &amp;c.
<i>Without</i>, it is surrounded with a <i>Thin</i> and <i>Smooth Membrane</i>
from the <span class='sc'>Peritonæum</span>; and <i>within</i> its <i>Cavity</i>, furnished
with a <i>Thick</i>, <i>Porous</i>, and <i>Nervous one</i>, call’d the
proper <i>Membrane</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Veins</i> and <i>Arteries</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, proceed from
the <i>Spermatick Vessels</i>, and <span class='sc'>Hypogastricks</span>; which <i>Vessels</i>
are all inserted in the proper <i>Membrane</i>. The <i>Arteries</i> convey
the <span class='sc'>Blood</span> for its Nourishment; which accumulating
and abounding there in <i>great Quantity</i>, at <i>Maturity</i> of
Years (when no <i>more</i> is requir’d for the <i>Encrease</i> or <i>Growth</i>
of the Body) it distends the <i>Vessels</i>, and distills into the
Bottom of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>: Whence proceeds the <i>Blood</i>
which nourisheth the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span> in the <i>Pregnant Woman</i>,
and the <i>Monthly Terms</i> or <span class='sc'>Menstrua</span> in the <i>Woman not
with Child</i>; which <i>Evacuation</i>, <span class='sc'>Men</span> Themselves are also
subject to in a great Measure; (notwithstanding their
inconsiderate <i>Detractions</i> and vain <i>Talk</i> on this Head)
save only that in <span class='sc'>Them</span> the <i>Redundant Humour</i> passes off
a different Way by <i>Urine</i>, by the <i>Nose</i>, and sometimes by
the <i>Hemorrhoidal Veins</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>VEINS</i> Serve only to reconduct to the <i>Heart</i>,
the <span class='sc'>Blood</span> which is neither wholly evacuated nor consum’d,
as I observed more at large <i>Before</i>. But the
<span class='sc'>Nerves</span> arise from the <i>Intercostals</i>, and those of the <span class='sc'>Os
Sacrum</span>; remarkable <i>Branches</i> of which run along the
Back of the <i>Clitoris</i>, from whence this <i>Part</i> is susceptible
of the very slightest <i>Impression</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THERE</em> are moreover other small <i>Vessels</i>, springing
one from another, which tend to this <i>Orifice</i>, and
serve in <i>Plethorick Women</i> with <i>CHILD</i>, to carry off the
Superfluity of the <i>Humours</i>. And, in short, prudent
<i>Nature</i>, seems to have so ordered <i>These</i> to prevent
<i>ABORTION</i>, which might easily happen, if the <i>pregnant</i>
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> was too much expos’d, or was to open itself
for this Purpose.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Seminal</i> or <i>Spermatick Vessels</i> are <i>Four</i>, like as
they are computed to be also in <span class='sc'>Men</span>, and differ only
in being <i>shorter</i>. The <i>Blood Vessels</i> are very winding;
and the <i>Spermatick Arteries</i> arising with a narrow Origin
from the <i>Aorta</i>, form various <i>Plexus’s</i>, and <i>Inosculations</i>,
as <i>These</i> do: And the <i>Spermatick Veins</i> (tho’ without
<i>Valves</i>) have the like <i>Inosculations</i> with the <i>Arteries</i>,
which however in <i>These</i> are more conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>OVARIA</i>, or <i>TESTICLES</i>, are <i>Two Bodies</i>,
on each Side <i>One</i>, annexed to the Bottom of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
at about Two Fingers Distance, near the <i>broad Ligaments</i>:
<i>They</i> are fixed to the <span class='sc'>Peritonæum</span> at the <span class='sc'>Ilia</span>,
nigh the <i>Spermatick Vessels</i>: Their <i>Figure</i> is almost <i>Oval</i>,
a little depressed on the <i>Upper Part</i>, where the
<span class='sc'>Spermaticks</span> enter.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THEIR</em> <i>SIZE</i> is generally about half as <i>Big</i> as
<em class='gesperrt'><i>MEN</i></em>’s are; but <i>this</i> differs according to the <i>Age</i> and
<i>Constitution</i> of Persons: Their <i>Surface</i> is smooth, and
even in <i>Virgins</i>; but wrinkled, uneven, and dry in
<i>old Women</i>: They are encompass’d with a proper
strong <i>Membrane</i>, deriving its <i>Original</i> from the <i>PERITONÆUM</i>;
which also covers all the <i>Spermatick
Vessels</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THEIR</em> <i>Substance</i> is Membranous and Fibrous,
interwoven with a vast Number of <i>Vessels</i>; among which
are some round <i>Vesicles</i>, containing a viscous <span class='sc'>Humour</span>,
when boil’d, of the <i>Colour</i>, <i>Consistence</i>, and <i>Taste</i> of the
boil’d <i>White of an Egg</i>: From whence they are call’d
<span class='sc'>Eggs</span>, because of this <i>Analogy</i>. <i>These</i> also differ in <i>Size</i>
and <i>Number</i>, according to <i>Age</i> and <i>Constitution</i>, although
(ordinarily) the <i>Biggest</i> of them scarcely equals a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Pea</span></em>;
and there are in <i>some</i> Persons 10 or 12 of them, in
<i>others</i> (perhaps) but <i>One</i> or <i>Two</i> discernible.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Tubæ Fallopianæ</span>, are <i>Two winding Canals</i>,
resembling <i>Two Trumpets</i>, situated on the <i>Right</i> and
<i>Left</i> Side of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, annexed close to its <i>Bottom</i>, by
their double <i>Membrane</i>; which is only a Continuation of
the <i>exterior</i> and <i>interior Membranes</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>: They
in <i>SIZE</i> equal a little <i>Finger</i> about the Middle;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>tho’ the <i>Cavity</i> opening into the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>, will scarce
admit a <i>Hog’s Bristle</i>; but the <i>other Extremity</i>, floating
loose in the <span class='sc'>Abdomen</span>, will admit the Point or Tip of a
little <i>Finger</i>: They are of a Membranous and Cavernous
<i>Substance</i>, about 5 or 6 Inches long, and have the
same <i>Veins</i>, <i>Arteries</i>, and <i>Nerves</i>, as the <i>OVARIA</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>Tubes</i>, to be brief, (in time of <i>COITION</i>)
are erected by a copious Influx of <i>Blood</i> and <i>Spirits</i>;
which also, by the Assistance of their <i>muscular Fringes</i>,
embrace the <i>OVARIUM</i>, transmit the <i>prolifick Masculine</i>
<span class='sc'>Seed</span>, afterwards receive the <i>impregnated</i> <span class='sc'>Egg</span>, and
at last convey it thence into the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>. In fine, these
are all the <i>internal Parts</i>, as I conceive, tending to
<i>GENERATION</i>. But more particularly, to proceed

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VII.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>PELVIS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> being that <i>Cavity</i> in which the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is
placed, and through which the <i>INFANT</i> passes
in time of <i>BIRTH</i>; it is my Opinion that a distinct
<i>Knowledge</i> of it is highly necessary for all <i>MIDWIVES</i>
to accomplish their <i>Practice</i>: For without that <i>Qualification</i>,
they cannot help committing a great many
<i>Blunders</i>, and being guilty of innumerable <i>Mistakes</i>;
since they must proceed upon gross <i>Uncertainties</i>, and
use their <i>Hands</i> like <em class='gesperrt'><i>MEN</i></em> groping in the <i>Dark</i>, as
hereafter will more plainly appear.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> is that <i>Cavity</i> betwixt the <span class='sc'>Ossa Innominata</span>
and <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>; which join themselves in the <i>Posterior
Part</i> of it on each side, by <i>Cartilages</i> and <i>Ligaments</i>:
so that they, forming there a strong and firm <i>Juncture</i>,
compose this <i>Cavity</i> of the <i>PELVIS</i>, which is vulgarly
call’d the <i>Bason</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> upper Part of the <span class='sc'>Ossa <em class='gesperrt'>Pubis</em></span> forms the <i>Borders</i>
of this <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Cavity</span></em> <i>before</i>, and the Hanging forwards
or bending down of the <span class='sc'>Os <em class='gesperrt'>Sacrum</em></span> makes <i>Those</i> of it
<i>behind</i>; as the <span class='sc'>Ossa Ilia</span> compose the <i>same</i> on each
side.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <span class='sc'>Ossa Ilia</span> are (by <i>some</i>) call’d the <i>Wings</i>
and <i>Bounds</i> of the <i>PELVIS</i>; but they are mightily mistaken,
who imagine that they surround or encompass
the <i>PELVIS</i>: For they are only annexed to it on <i>each
side</i>, and more extended towards the <i>Back</i> than the
<i>Forepart</i>. As they are also very much in the <i>wrong</i>,
who think that the <i>Cavity</i> of the <i>PELVIS</i> extends in its
<i>Length</i>, according to the <i>Length</i> of the <span class='sc'>Back-Bone</span>:
since it rises from the <i>Bottom</i> obliquely, ascending <i>Forwards</i>,
and so proceeds, as if a Person might, through
its <i>Passage</i>, easily touch the <span class='sc'>Navel</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> fine, it is here Remarkable also, that we do not
always find the largest <i>PELVIS</i> in <i>Women</i> of the largest
<span class='sc'>Size</span>, but often the quite <i>contrary</i>; for it differs as the
<i>INFANT</i> does in <i>Bulk</i>, exactly answering to the <i>Bigness</i>
of its <span class='sc'>Head</span>: And in some <i>Women</i> it is <i>Deeper</i>, in
some <i>Larger</i>, in some <i>Broader</i>, in some <i>Flatter</i>, in some
more <i>Oval</i>, and in some at last <i>Rounder</i>. From whence
arise sundry <i>Observations</i> both useful and necessary, for
the better <i>Information</i> of <i>MIDWIVES</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VIII.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>BONES</em> of the <em class='gesperrt'>PELVIS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>I Doubt not in the least but <i>This</i> and the <i>proceeding
Chapter</i> will seem needless, and appear superfluous
to some Persons, in the <i>Practice</i> of <i>MIDWIFERY</i>;
namely, to such as know not the <i>New Improvements</i> of
this <span class='sc'>Art</span>: But especially to such as are accustom’d to
the <i>Use</i> of <span class='sc'>Instruments</span>, they’ll appear altogether
<i>Useless</i> and <i>Vain</i>; since such <i>Practitioners</i> can easily (upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>any Occasion, without the curious <i>Anatomical Knowledge</i>
of <i>these Parts</i>) first slay the <i>INFANT</i>, and then either
<i>deliver</i> or <i>kill</i> the <i>WOMAN</i>, as <i>Chance</i> may <i>direct</i> their
<i>SHARPS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> for my Part, because I have no Notion of
such sort of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Weapons</span></em>, I shall endeavour to acquit my
self more <i>honourably</i>, and teach my <i>Followers</i> another
way, and <i>That</i> without <span class='sc'>Blood-shed</span>; as I hope will
hereafter more amply appear.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> <span class='sc'>First</span> therefore in speaking of the <i>Bones</i> of the
<i>PELVIS</i>, I shall begin with the <i>OSSA Innominata</i>;
which are <i>two</i> large <i>Bones</i> joined to the <i>Sides</i> of the <i>OS
SACRUM</i>. <i>They</i> are compos’d of <i>Three</i> distinct <i>Pieces</i>,
each of which has its respective <i>Name</i>: The <span class='sc'>First</span>
and <i>superior</i> is call’d <span class='sc'>Os Ilium</span>; because the <i>Guts</i> <span class='sc'>Ilia</span>
lie upon it directly. It is <i>Large</i> and almost of a <i>Semicircular
Figure</i>, a little <i>Convex</i> and <i>Uneven</i> on its <i>External
Side</i>; as it is <i>Concave</i> and <i>Smooth</i> on the <i>Internal</i>. In
short, it is join’d to the <i>Sides</i> of the <i>three Superior</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span></em>
of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span></em>, and is <i>Larger</i> in <i>WOMEN</i>
than in <i>MEN</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Second</span> and <i>Anterior</i> is call’d <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Os Pubis</span></em>;
which is united in the <i>Forepart</i> to its <i>Fellow-BONE</i> of
the <i>other Side</i>, by an intervening <i>Cartilage</i>: By the Extension
of which <i>Cartilage</i>, the <span class='sc'>Ossa Pubis</span> in <i>Young
Women</i>, sometimes recede a little from <i>One another</i>, to
facilitate a difficult <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Birth</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Third</span> is the <i>Inferiour</i> and <i>Posteriour</i>, call’d
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Os Ischium</span></em>, or <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coxendix</span></span></em>, which has a large <i>Cavity</i>
call’d <i>Acetabulum Coxendicis</i>; and This receives the <i>Head</i>
of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Os Femoris</span></em>; the <i>Supercilium</i> or <i>Top</i> of which
<i>Cavity</i> joins the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Os Pubis</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>Three Bones</i>, until the Age of <i>Puberty</i>, may
be seen distinctly, tho’ afterwards they grow together,
and become <i>one BONE</i>, without leaving any Mark of
<i>Division</i>. They adhere on each <i>side</i> to the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span></em>
by <i>two Strong Ligaments</i>; the <i>Upper</i> of which passes from
the <i>Posteriour Acute Process</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Ischium</span></em> to the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Sacrum</span></em>; as the <i>Lower</i> joins the <i>Tuberculum</i> <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ischii</span></span> to
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Sacrum</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>Bones</i> in <i>WOMEN</i> are more distant or separated
from <i>One another</i>, and are <i>smaller</i> than in <i>MEN</i>;
especially the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Os Pubis</span></em>, to the end that the <i>Cavity</i> of
the <i>PELVIS</i>, and the <i>Angle</i> betwixt the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Os Pubis</span></em> and
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Ischium</span></em>, may be the <i>Larger</i>, for the more commodious
<i>Bearing</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Infant</span></em>, and the more easy <i>Exclusion</i> of
it in <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Birth</span></em>. But from hence I would no ways infer,
that the <span class='sc'>Ossa Pubis</span> and <span class='sc'>Ilia</span> sever themselves in time
of <i>LABOUR</i>; (notwithstanding the <i>Opinion</i> of <i>some Authors</i>)
for I am fully satisfied of the <i>contrary</i>: Because I
have conducted more than one <i>Woman</i> in my Time,
upon walking out of <i>one Chamber</i> into <i>another</i>, immediately
after <i>DELIVERY</i>; which could never have
happen’d in <i>Case</i> of such a distant or dislocated <i>Separation</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <i>Bones</i> call’d <i>Innominata</i> are of wonderful
<i>Use</i> and <i>Service</i>: For besides that they form the <i>PELVIS</i>,
and defend every Part of its <i>Contents</i>, they also give <i>Connexion</i>
and <i>Juncture</i> of the rest of the Body, to the <i>Thigh-Bones</i>;
as they likewise give <i>Rise</i> and <i>Origin</i> to many
<span class='sc'>Muscles</span>, and are the <i>Basis</i> of Support of the <span class='sc'>Spine</span> of
the <i>Back</i>, as well as of all the <i>Superior Parts</i>. Whence
I come <i>à propos</i> to descant a little upon this particular
<i>Part</i>, as far as concerns our present Purpose.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Spine</span> then is that <i>Bony Column</i> or <i>Ridge</i>,
which extends itself down the <i>Back</i> from the <span class='sc'>Head</span> to
the <i>Fundament</i>, containing the <i>Spinal Marrow</i>, and resembling
the <i>Letter</i> S in figure.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> This <span class='sc'>Spina</span> therefore we must consider its <i>Fivefold
Division</i>; namely, into <span class='sc'>Neck</span>, <span class='sc'>Back</span>, <span class='sc'>Loins</span>, <span class='sc'>Os
Sacrum</span>, and <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>. The First <i>Three</i> consist of
24 <span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span>; whereof the <i>Neck</i> has 7, the <i>Back</i> 12,
and 5 belong to the <i>Loins</i>. <i>Those</i> of the <span class='sc'>Neck</span> bend <i>inwards</i>;
those of the <span class='sc'>Back</span> <i>outwards</i>, for enlarging the
<i>Cavity</i> of the <span class='sc'>Thorax</span>; <i>Those</i> of the <span class='sc'>Loins</span> bend <i>inwards</i>
again; and <i>Those</i> of the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span> <i>outwards</i>, to enlarge
the <i>Cavity</i> of the <i>PELVIS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span> of the <i>two last</i> concern us most in
this Place; wherefore I shall say no more of the <i>rest</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>save only by the By, or coincidently, as they fall in my
way. <i>Those</i> of the <span class='sc'>Loins</span> then are the <i>Thickest</i> and
<i>Broadest</i>, and the <i>Last</i> of them is the <i>Largest</i> of all the
<span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span>; as their <i>Cartilages</i> are thicker and stronger
than any of the <i>Others</i>, and their <i>Acute Processes</i> are at a
greater <i>Distance</i> from one another. From whence it
comes to pass, that the greatest <i>Motion</i> of the <span class='sc'>Back</span> is
perform’d by the <span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span> of the <span class='sc'>Loins</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span> of the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span> grow so close
together in <i>Adults</i>, that they make but one large solid
<i>BONE</i>, of a <i>Triangular Figure</i>; and yet not without
the <i>Mark</i> of a four or five-fold <i>Division</i>: As in <span class='sc'>Children</span>,
it consists of many more <i>Pieces</i> or <i>Divisions</i>.
However, its <i>Basis</i> is tyed to the last <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span></em> of
the <span class='sc'>Loins</span>, and the <i>Upper part</i> of its <i>Sides</i> to the <span class='sc'>Ilia</span>;
as its <i>Point</i> is to the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span> is also in <i>Adults</i>, for the most
part, but one entire <i>BONE</i>; tho’ in <i>younger Persons</i> it is
compos’d of 3 or 4 small <i>Divisions</i>; Of which the <i>Lower</i>
is still less than the <i>Upper</i>; till the <i>Last</i> ends in a small
<i>Cartilage</i>. It is join’d in its <i>Glenoide Cavity</i> to the Extremity
of the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>; being short and bent <i>inwards</i>:
It supports the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Intestinum Rectum</span></em>, and
yields to the <i>Pressure</i> of the <i>INFANT</i> in <i>Travail</i>: But
<i>MIDWIVES</i> ought not to thrust it back or repel it
with <i>Violence</i>; No, they should rather handle it <i>gently</i>, if
they would prevent dangerous <i>Consequences</i>, as well as
great <i>Pain</i> to the <i>Woman</i> in <i>LABOUR</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> hence it is manifest, that <i>they</i> are mistaken
who imagine that the <i>Opening</i> and <i>Enlargement</i> of the
<i>PELVIS</i>, in making way for the <i>INFANT</i>, does depend
upon the <i>Separation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Ossa Pubis</span>: For it
much more depends upon the <i>yielding</i> of the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>,
or its giving way naturally; especially <i>This Part</i> of it
call’d <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>. Neither doth the <i>Straitness</i> of the
<i>Upper Part</i> of the <i>PELVIS</i> so much occasion a difficult
<i>BIRTH</i>, as the <i>small Distance</i> that is betwixt the <i>Points</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Ossa Pubis</span>, call’d <span class='sc'>Ossa <em class='gesperrt'>Sedentaria</em></span> or <i>Seat-Bones</i>,
and the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>: No indeed, neither of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span><i>These</i> can be any great <i>Hindrance</i> to the Passage of the
<span class='sc'>Infant</span>; since all <span class='sc'>Bones</span>, never so closely knit together
with <span class='sc'>Ligaments</span>, may be moved <i>extensively</i> upon
occasion, by carefully and gently <i>stretching</i> the said <span class='sc'>Ligaments</span>.
But, in short, it most commonly happens,
that the <i>Ill Position</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> itself, or the bad
<i>Condition</i> and <i>Situation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, or <i>Both</i>, occasion
a difficult or preternatural <span class='sc'>Birth</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> I would here farther observe yet, that as
these <span class='sc'>Bones</span> differ frequently both in <i>Form</i> and <i>Size</i>, according
to the different <i>Constitution</i> of the Body; so
neither are <i>they</i> always of the <i>same Substance</i>: For in <i>some
Women</i>, we find a great many <i>Nervous</i> and <i>Cartilaginous</i>
<span class='sc'>Ligaments</span>, which penetrate into the <i>solid Substance</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Bones</span> themselves; in which the <span class='sc'>Ligaments</span> are so
fast bound together, that it is hard to distinguish whether
they are <i>One</i> or <i>More</i> <span class='sc'>Bones</span>. From whence, however,
it will hereafter appear, that <i>One Woman</i> is more
easily delivered than <i>Another</i>; the <span class='sc'>Bones</span> in <i>One</i> being
more firm and immoveable, altogether resisting any
<i>Relaxation</i>; which in <i>Another</i> are more loose and pliable,
easily give way and yield freely to the <i>Force</i> of
the Endeavouring and Struggling <i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Contents</i> of this <span class='sc'>Section</span> will appear more
evident, by looking curiously upon a <i>Female <em class='gesperrt'>SKELETON</em></i>:
In which (for Distinction’s-sake I recite <i>This</i>)
that the lower Parts of the <i>Seat-Bones</i>, are generally
more <i>distant</i>, and not so much bent <i>inwards</i>, down towards
the Point of the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>, as in a <i>Male
SKELETON</i>. Which Difference, in short, the Omniscient
<span class='sc'>Creator</span> has so order’d, for preventing difficult
<i>BIRTHS</i>; and yet, notwithstanding all this wise
Provision of Nature, they happen too often in the
World. However, having thus, in fine, described the
<span class='sc'>Pelvis</span> and its <span class='sc'>Bones</span>, as far as is requisite for <em class='gesperrt'><i>MIDWIVES</i></em>,
I come next, more particularly to describe
that astonishing <i>Piece</i> of <span class='sc'>God’s</span> <i>Handy-work</i>, to which
all the afore-mention’d <i>Parts</i> are ordain’d to <i>minister</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>and that both <i>conjunctly</i> and <i>severally</i>, without any <i>Exception</i>:

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> IX.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>I Say this is that <i>Body</i>, which the <i>Learned Great Men</i>
of all Ages have esteem’d and look’d upon as the
most wonderful <span class='sc'>Miracle</span> of <i>Nature</i>, not only because
of its singular <i>Substance</i> and <i>Structure</i>, but also of its
peculiar <i>Qualities</i> and <i>Faculties</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the <i>Substance</i> and <i>Structure</i>, I have before observed
in <i>Chap. 6.</i> of this <span class='sc'>Section</span>, that it is singularly
composed, of an innumerable Multitude of <i>Fibrous
Vessels</i> and <i>Muscular Parts</i>; which being <i>All</i> most curiously
interwoven, are admirably form’d together in its
Constitution.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> how particular soever I have been on this
<i>Head</i>, in <i>Chap. 5</i>, and <i>6</i>. I must resume this <i>Topick</i> here,
and add, that the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and its <i>Vagina</i> or <i>Neck</i>, are
closely join’d together: For it terminates in a <span class='sc'>Point</span>
near its <i>Orifice</i>, intrudes itself into the <i>Vagina</i>, and
hangs so down, that in <i>Women not with</i> <span class='sc'>Child</span>, and
sometimes also in the first Months of <i>Pregnancy</i>, This
sharp <span class='sc'>Point</span> may be perceiv’d by the <i>Touch</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> how closely soever this <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
is shut after <i>Conception</i> or during <i>Pregnancy</i>; yet in a
<i>BIRTH</i> it is so expanded, that the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and <i>Vagina</i>
both seem to have but <i>One</i> and the <i>same Cavity</i>, like a
<span class='sc'>Bag</span> of equal Dimensions; there being then no Difference
perceivable between that <i>Orifice</i> and the <i>Vagina</i>,
excepting that the <i>VAGINA</i> is <i>Softer</i> and <i>Thinner</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Womb</span> may be otherwise aptly compar’d to
the <span class='sc'>Earth</span>; because the same Degree of <i>Affinity</i> that
the <span class='sc'>Earth</span> has to the <i>Seed of Plants</i>, the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> bears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>to the <i>Seed of Men</i>: It being the very <i>Secundary Cause</i> in
the <i>Constitution</i> of the <i>Human Conception</i>; not indeed the
<i>Instrumental</i> only, but also the <i>Active Cause</i>: For whereas
the <i>Instrument</i> takes <i>Motion</i> from, and <i>operates</i> by Virtue
of <i>Another</i>, the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> only <i>acts</i> of <i>itself</i> and <i>operates</i>
by Virtue of its own <i>Active Faculties</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> more particularly, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> has sundry
proper <i>Actions</i> in this <i>Constitution</i>, which are peculiarly
dependent of, and accordingly discharged by <span class='sc'>Itself</span>
only; and therefore it is not the sole or pure Instrumental
<i>Agent</i>. But the Reason that I call it the <i>Secundary</i>
or <i>Disponent</i>, not the <i>Primary Cause</i>, in constituting
the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span>, is, because the <i>Actions</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
do not precisely terminate in this <i>Constitution</i>, but chiefly
in disposing the <i>Causes</i> constituting the <span class='sc'>Man</span>. And
as (I think) there are <i>Eight</i> such <i>Actions</i> belonging to
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, I shall undertake to define them all particularly
in a few Words. And,</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>FIRST Action</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is, that by its
<i>attractive Faculty</i>, it may allure the <i>Masculine Seed</i> infus’d
by Coition into the <span class='sc'>Fund</span> of its <i>Capacity</i>, after the
same manner as a <i>famishing Stomach</i> snatches at the Victuals
by the <i>Gullet</i> from the <i>Mouth</i> of the Eater.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>SECOND</i> is like unto the <i>FIRST</i>, and
consists in <i>attracting</i> (after the same manner) the <i>Muliebrian</i>
<span class='sc'>Seed</span> from the Vessels of the <span class='sc'>Testicles</span>, into the
same <i>Cavity</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>THIRD Function</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, is the
<i>Copulation</i> and mutual <i>Conjunction</i> of the <span class='sc'>Seeds</span> of both
Parents; which it prepares and perfects by its innate
<i>Power</i>, constricting itself in all Parts: And this <i>Action</i>,
I do not (in this place) call a <i>Permistion</i> of these <span class='sc'>Seeds</span>,
as it is generally term’d, because a <i>Mixture</i> is properly
perform’d only by the concording <i>Qualities</i> and mutual
<i>Actions</i> of two or more miscible <i>Copulatives</i>, without
any <i>Assistance</i> of the <i>Thing Containing</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>FOURTH Office</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, is an
<i>Effusion</i> of the <i>Menstruous Blood</i> upon the aggregated

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>FIFTH Action</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, is, the

which <i>Work</i>, the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> contracts itself on all sides,
and shuts up all its <i>Orifices</i>, even to the sensible Animadversion
of the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>SIXTH Function</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, is to
excite the Virtue of the <i>Torpent Lifeless</i> <span class='sc'>Seed</span>, and rouze
it up from <i>Idleness</i> to <i>Activity</i>; as the latent Virtue of

<p class='c005'>VII. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>SEVENTH Office</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, is (after

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> all which we may easily collect the sundry

for constituting the <i>Conception</i>; fomenting the receiv’d

for the Use of the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span>: Which <span class='sc'>Foetus</span> it

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> X.</span><br /> <i>Of the Extensive Faculty of the <em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>NATURE</em> has endued the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> with this <i>Faculty</i>,
to the end that it may (in <i>Pregnancy</i>) extend
and dilate itself Day by Day, in <i>Proportion</i> to the
<i>Growth</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, <i>Secundine</i>, and <i>Humours</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> in its <i>lower Part</i> being straitly
tied to the <i>Intestinum Rectum</i> and <i>Bladder</i>; it is to be
understood that the <i>Distention</i> happens mostly in its superiour
Part or <i>Bottom</i>: Which is not only most <i>Free</i>
and at greatest <i>Liberty</i>, but also <i>Thickest</i> and aptest for
<i>Dilatation</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> will appear more evident, when we consider
how the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> adheres to that Part, the <i>Bottom</i>, by
means of the <i>Secundine</i>: How the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> also as it
grows, begins to separate the <i>Humours</i> in the <i>Secundine</i>,
which (of consequence) encrease as the <i>Infant</i> does:
And how again the Encrease of the <i>Humours</i> fill up the
<i>Chinks</i> and <span class='sc'>Vacuums</span>, as I may call them, which the
<span class='sc'>Infant</span> cannot possess. From hence it is that the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
extends itself in the <i>Form</i> of a <span class='sc'>Pear</span>, only a little <i>Plainer</i>
at Both Ends.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> the <i>Secundine</i> adhering<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c017'><sup>[155]</sup></a> to the <i>Bottom</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, by its <i>thicker Part</i> (call’d the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Placenta</em></span>,)
thence it is that the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> encreases and extends itself
more in its <i>Bottom</i>, than in any <i>inferiour Part</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> being most extended
in its upper Part, call’d the <i>Bottom</i>; and both the
<i>Bladder</i> and <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Rectum</span></em> below being soft loose <i>Parts</i>,
it necessarily follows, that the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> may freely <i>ascend</i>
and <i>descend</i> upon Occasion, as we often find it in the
<i>Cavity</i> of the <i>Belly</i>; which, however, does not happen to
All <i>Women</i> alike.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em>, in short, these <i>extensive</i> and <i>ascensive Faculties</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, chiefly residing in its <i>Bottom</i>; I would
have it laid down for a certain <i>Maxim</i> of Truth, that
<i>These</i> exert themselves, without any the least <i>Extenuation</i>
to the <i>Uterine Substance</i>: Which Position leads me
directly to consider——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XI.</span><br /> <i>Of the Substantial Density of the <em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>TOUCHING</em> the <i>Thickness</i> of the <i>Pregnant</i> <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
<i>Authors</i> have differ’d extremely: <i>Some</i> thinking,
that as the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> grows <i>Larger</i>, it grows <i>Thicker</i>; and
<i>Others</i> the <i>Reverse</i>, that as it <i>extends</i>, it grows <i>Thinner</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> these <i>Opinions</i> being both diametrically opposite
<i>One</i> to the <i>Other</i>, as <i>Both</i> (perhaps) may be contrary
to <i>Truth</i>, I shall freely and ingenuously offer my
<i>Sentiments</i> in a few Words; not that I vainly desire to
engage myself in any <i>Controversy</i>: Save only, because
the true <i>Knowledge</i> of this Point, is so Material and
Consequential for all <i>MIDWIVES</i>, especially in <i>Cases</i> of
difficult and preternatural <span class='sc'>Births</span>, that I cannot well excuse
myself, should I pass it by with <i>Silence</i> in this Place.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Mr.</span></em> <i>MAURICEAU</i>, in his <i>Book</i> of the <i>Diseases</i> of
Women, contradicting the Authority of <i>Riolanus</i>, <i>Bartholinus</i>,
and the whole Body of the most Renown’d
and Ingenious <i>Anatomists</i>, both <i>Ancient</i> and <i>Modern</i>, is
at great Pains to make us believe, that the <i>impregnated</i>
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> is (like the <i>Bladder</i>) in this Case; <i>the more it is
extended, the thinner it grows</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> as his quoted Authority of <i>Galen</i> and <i>Carol</i>.
<i>Stephanus</i> cannot be sufficient against so many good
<i>Authors</i> of the <i>contrary Opinion</i>; so neither will his <i>Demonstrations</i>
of <span class='sc'>Wax</span>, nor <i>Comparisons with the</i> <span class='sc'>Wombs</span> of
<i>Animals</i>, be sufficient to make out his <i>Argument</i>, against
confirm’d <i>Experience</i>, common <i>Sense</i>, and current <i>Reason</i>.
Which Point of <i>Experience</i> I judge this <i>Author</i> to
have been deficient in, otherwise he would certainly
have given us some <i>particular Instance</i> or other of it, and
not had <i>Recourse</i> to <i>Inconsistencies</i> for supporting his new-fashion’d
unreceiv’d <i>Notion</i>. For what <i>Comparison</i> can
there be betwixt an <i>Animate</i> and <i>Inanimate Body</i>? Or
what <i>Affinity</i> betwixt the <i>WOMB</i> of <i>Animals</i> and that
of <i>Women</i>, who are form’d after the <i>Image</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>,
and (by a <i>Prerogative</i> above all other <i>Creatures</i>) are furnished
with a <i>WOMB</i> very <i>different</i> from them?</p>

<p class='c005'>I ingenuously acknowledge, when I first met with
this <i>Author’s Works</i>, not daring then to be too <i>Positive</i>
in this <i>Point</i>, I was put into some <i>Suspence</i> of Judgment;
which made me not only consult with the best of <i>Authors</i>
and <i>Professors</i> of <span class='sc'>Anatomy</span>, but also induc’d me to
embrace every Opportunity of satisfying myself otherways
to a full <i>Conviction</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> at all <i>Dissections</i> of <i>pregnant Women</i>,
where I have been present, I carefully observed
and took notice of this particular <i>Point</i>; upon which I
must needs affirm, that I always found the <i>WOMB</i>
(however <i>Big</i> or <i>Little</i>) of its <i>natural Thickness</i>, and
rather <i>thicker</i> than <i>thinner</i>: For tho’ <i>It</i> is expanded by
the <i>growing Infant</i>, &amp;c. yet <i>it</i> may (most probably) be
equally condensed, by the Imbibition of the <i>fluent Humours</i>,
which consolidate into <i>itself</i> by the <i>Pores</i> of
its <i>Plexus Body</i>. Nay, I have not only satisfy’d
myself in <i>dead</i>, but also in <i>living Bodies</i>, with respect
to this Matter; for by passing <i>One Hand</i> into the
<i>WOMB</i> to take away the <i>Secundine</i>, when the <i>Other</i> laid
upon the <span class='sc'>Belly</span>, I clearly discerned the <i>Truth</i> by <span class='sc'>Sense</span>,
and have sometimes found the <em class='gesperrt'><i>WOMB</i></em> not only incredibly
<i>Thick</i>, but also <span class='sc'>Rigid</span> withal: And in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Matter, I have not been singular; for I find the <i>ingenious
Daventer</i> writes to the same purpose, upon this
<i>Head</i>, in his Book of <i>Midwifery</i>. Having therefore
thus, in short, perceiv’d the <i>Thickness</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><i>WOMB</i></em>,
both with my <i>Hands</i> and <i>Eyes</i>, I must trust my <span class='sc'>Senses</span>,
and prefer my <i>Experience</i> before any <i>Man’s bare Conjecture</i>;
for tho’ I often <i>see not</i> those Things which I <i>believe</i>,
yet I must still <i>believe</i> those Things which I <i>see</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHENCE</em> I conclude, that the <i>WOMB</i>, tho’ of
a different <i>Bigness</i> from the <i>Conception</i> to the <span class='sc'>Birth</span>, is
always, at least, of one <i>Thickness</i> with the <i>unconceiv’d</i>
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>: Which the <i>Divine Wisdom</i> (no doubt) has so ordered
for the <i>Preservation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Mother</span> and <span class='sc'>Infant</span>; for if
the <em class='gesperrt'><i>WOMB</i></em> in Time of <i>Pregnancy</i> did grow <i>Thinner</i>,
according to its <i>Extension</i>, it must of Consequence
grow <i>Weaker</i>, and, in that <i>Case</i> the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> would be
liable to perforate it with <i>Foot</i> or <i>Hand</i>, which would
infallibly terminate in the <i>Loss</i> of both their <span class='sc'>Lives</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> besides, if the <i>WOMB</i> was so <i>Thin</i> and <i>Weak</i>
as Mr. <i>Mauriceau</i> imagines; as the <i>Pregnant Woman</i>
would be liable to imminent <i>Danger</i> every Moment <i>Before</i>,
as well as <i>In Time</i> of <span class='sc'>Labour</span>; so the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span>
would be expos’d to the greatest of <i>Difficulties</i>: For
who then durst, without <i>Horror</i>, offer to turn the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>,
so closely compress’d in those <i>thin Membranes</i> of
the <em class='gesperrt'><i>WOMB</i></em>? Or who could have <i>Resolution</i> enough
to separate and pull away the <span class='sc'>After-Birth</span>?</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, I could produce innumerable <i>Instances</i>
of most Learned and Ingenious <i>Men</i> to support
my above-mentioned <i>Opinion</i>; but I shall content myself
now with <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>One</span></em>, who (I think) is of sufficient
Authority: For hearing lately that Mr. <i>Mauriceau</i>’s
mention’d Book (which I had only read before in its
<i>Original French</i>) was translated by Dr. <i>Chamberlain</i>, I
doubted not but I should fully discover that Eminent
<span class='sc'>Translator’s</span> <i>Sentiment</i> upon this single <i>Point</i>; whereupon
this most famous <i>Physician</i> and <i>Boethogynist</i> marks
by way of Observation or a <i>Bene Notandum</i>, that his
<i>Charity</i> for his <i>Author</i> makes him believe that <i>French-Women</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>differ in this <i>Point</i> from <i>Our English</i>, with whom
it is apparently otherwise order’d. And in the farther
Explication of his <i>Author’s Opinion</i> on this <i>Head</i>, he adds,
That <i>Experience</i> will convince any inquisitive Person of
the <i>Contrary</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>TO</em> which I reply, in short, with all due Submission,
that the <i>French-Women</i> do not differ one Jot in this respect
from <i>Ours</i>, nor <i>Ours</i> from any <i>Others</i>: Which (no doubt)
the worthy <i>Doctor</i> was very sensible of, notwithstanding
his great <i>Complaisance</i> to his <i>Author</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XII.</span><br /> <i>Of the various Local Motion of the WOMB.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>ALTHOUGH</em> the <i>Ligaments</i> are fixed to the
<i>WOMB</i> on each side, under the <i>Tubes</i>, near the
<i>Bottom</i>, on purpose to keep it duly in the <i>Middle</i>, from
falling to either <i>Side</i>; yet we may easily perceive,
<span class='sc'>First</span>, That the <i>Pregnant WOMB</i>, as it dilates and extends
itself most (in the <i>Bottom</i>) above the <i>Ligaments</i>,
so it rises <i>Highest</i> and becomes <i>Heaviest</i> in that Part;
by which means it cannot always be contained in the
<i>narrow Compass</i> of the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, and the <i>Larger</i> the <i>INFANT</i>
is, the <i>Higher</i> the <i>WOMB</i> rises (above the <i>Ligaments</i>)
in the <span class='sc'>Belly</span>. Insomuch that when the <i>Cavity</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span> is not sufficient to contain a large
<i>WOMB</i>, fill’d with <i>One</i> or <i>more</i> well-grown <i>INFANTS</i>,
together with the <i>Secundines</i> and <i>Humours</i>, it must (of
necessity) ascend into the <i>Cavity</i> of the <span class='sc'>Belly</span>; as is
evident from <i>Chap. 10</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, The <i>WOMB</i> being in Form of a
<span class='sc'>Pear</span>, much larger <i>above</i> than <i>below</i> the <i>Ligaments</i>, and
that <i>superiour Bulk</i> being only sustain’d at the <i>lower Part</i>
by subtile <i>Ligaments</i> apt to extend, as well as supported
near the <i>Orifice</i> by the <i>Bladder</i> and <span class='sc'>Rectum</span>, which
are soft, loose, and <i>extensive Parts</i>: Hence, I say, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>may easily conceive, that as <i>These</i> are not sufficient to
hinder a large <span class='sc'>Womb</span> from ascending above the Borders
of the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span> into the <i>Cavity</i> of the <span class='sc'>Belly</span>; so neither
are <i>they</i> able to keep it from leaning or inclining <i>this</i>
or <i>that way</i>, by reason of its <i>Weight</i> in the <i>Bottom</i>,
which is always the farther distant from the <i>Ligaments</i>,
the more it is <i>extended</i>: And the <i>extended</i> <span class='sc'>Womb</span> being
not of the same <i>Firmness</i> and <i>Solidity</i> with <span class='sc'>That</span> in a
<i>natural State</i>, is the more apt and ready to move <i>aside</i>,
either on the Right or the Left Hand.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> this various <i>Motion</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, in short,
will appear more manifestly <i>Probable</i>, when we consider
how variously <i>Women</i> with <span class='sc'>Child</span> move their <i>Bodies</i>,
bending them every way for <i>Relief</i>, when oppress’d with
<i>Pain</i>; both <i>sitting</i> and <i>lying</i> in different <i>Postures</i>: All
which may easily give the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> a <i>Tendency</i> this or that
way, sliding either <i>Forwards</i> or <i>Backwards</i>, to the right
or the left <i>Side</i> of the Person.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XIII.</span><br /> <i>Of the Oblique Situation of the <em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>I Doubt not in the least but among the <i>Many</i>, some
will reject <i>this</i> <span class='sc'>Thesis</span> as <i>False</i> or <i>New-fangled</i>;
but <i>They</i> who are <i>Ignorant</i> of it, are meer blind <i>Novices</i>
in the <i>Art</i> of <span class='sc'>Midwifery</span>: For repeated <i>Experience</i>
has taught <i>Myself</i> and many <i>Others</i> the Certainty of
this <i>Truth</i>; as will more amply appear from the following
Discourse.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Womb</i> having then ascended into the <i>Cavity</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Belly</span>, if its <i>pointed Parts</i> tend perpendicularly
into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, so as that its <i>Orifice</i> may be easily
touch’d on every <i>Side</i> with the Fingers, its <i>Bottom</i> is
placed about the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Navel</span></em>; and <i>This</i> I call a right or
<i>natural Situation</i>: But when otherways, the <i>Posture</i> is
changed, inclining <i>this</i> or <i>that way</i>, and the <i>Orifice</i> suspended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>so <i>High</i>, that it can scarce or not at all be
touch’d, I call <i>That</i> a wrong and <i>preternatural Position</i>,
or <i>oblique Situation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; which may not only
be occasion’d (as is said) by the <i>Weight</i> and <i>Bulk</i> of
its <i>Bottom</i>, above the extended and relaxed <i>Ligaments</i>,
but also by many other different <i>Causes</i>; such as an obdurated
<i>Gland</i>, a <i>Cicatrix</i>, an <i>Ulcer</i>, an <i>Obstruction</i> of the
<i>Vessels</i> in the <i>Ligaments</i> or adjacent <i>Parts</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> it is that the <i>wrong Positions</i> of the
<i>WOMB</i> are manifold, which would be very tedious to
enumerate exactly here; but only, that I may not pass
by what is so <i>material</i>, I shall reduce them to a <i>Four-fold
Difference</i>; as the <i>Ancients</i> did the <i>Winds</i>, because of
the <i>Four Regions</i> or <i>Limits</i> of the Heavens. And <i>Those
Four</i> will (I hope) comprehend all other <i>wrong Situations</i>
of the <i>WOMB</i>, not very improperly or <i>mal-à-propos</i>, as
<i>Ovid</i><a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c017'><sup>[156]</sup></a> has comprehended <i>These</i> in the following elegant
<i>Verses</i>, viz.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>first</i> bad <i>Position</i> of which is, when the <i>Bottom</i>
of the <i>WOMB</i> is placed on the <i>left Side</i> of the
Woman, a little raised or depress’d; the <i>Orifice</i> being
turn’d towards the <span class='sc'>Spine</span> of the right <span class='sc'>Os Ilium</span> or <span class='sc'>Os
Pubis</span>, against which the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> in time of <span class='sc'>Birth</span>
commonly pushes its <i>Head</i>, beats out its Brains, and
sticks there to Death: Or else passing the said <span class='sc'>Spine</span>,
it lies <i>a-thwart</i> the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Second</i> ill <i>Position</i> of the <i>WOMB</i> is, when the
<i>Bottom</i> is seated on the <i>right Side</i>; the <i>Orifice</i> being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>turn’d towards the <i>left Part</i> of the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, directly opposite
to the <i>other Position</i>, and attended with the same
<i>Inconveniencies</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Third</i> is, when, in <i>Women</i> having large <i>Bellies</i>,
the <i>WOMB</i> hangs too much <i>Forwards</i>; the <i>Orifice</i>
being turn’d towards the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>: So that the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>
falls down by the <i>Head</i> into the Bent, or crooked
<i>Cavity</i> of the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>, where it fatally sticks fast.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>fourth Oblique Situation</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><i>WOMB</i></em> is,
when its <i>Bottom</i> is press’d too near the <span class='sc'>Diaphragma</span>,
and its <i>Body</i> too near the <span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span> of the <i>Loins</i>; the
<i>Orifice</i> being elevated, is thereby turned too near the
<i>OS PUBIS</i>, where the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> striking its <i>Head</i> against
these <i>Bones</i>, remains immoveable and perishes: Or,
(which is worse) sliding with its <i>Head</i> upon the <i>OSSA
PUBIS</i>, it is turn’d on one or other <i>Side</i> or <i>Backwards</i>;
when (commonly with <i>Hand</i> or <i>Arm</i> out of the
Body) it lies <i>a-thwart</i> the Passage, and infallibly occasions
its <span class='sc'>Own</span> or its <span class='sc'>Mother’s</span> <i>Death</i>, or <i>Both</i>; unless
(as in the <i>three</i> preceding <i>Cases</i>) it be in due time prevented
by the <i>Assistance</i> of some very skilful <span class='sc'>Hand</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THOSE</em> are the <i>Four</i> most difficult and principal
wrong, or chief <i>preternatural Situations</i>, of the <i>WOMB</i>; from
whence we may easily frame a competent Conjecture of
the <i>Rest</i>; to wit, when the <i>Bottom</i> of the <i>WOMB</i> is
more or less turn’d to the <i>right</i>, or the <i>left Side</i>, or <i>forwards</i>,
or <i>backwards</i>: Since as <i>that</i> differs more or less
from the <i>natural Position</i>, so the <span class='sc'>Birth</span> in like manner is
(of consequence) the more or less <i>Difficult</i>, as will hereafter
manifestly appear.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XIV.</span><br /> <i>Of <em class='gesperrt'>TOUCHING</em> or <em class='gesperrt'>HANDLING</em> the Woman.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Midwife</i> ought to have a special <i>Knowledge</i> in
<i>This</i> Matter, since a Thing of so much Moment
as <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Life</span></em> itself often depends upon it; yea, and <i>this
Knowledge</i> is of absolute Necessity to all Persons practising
<span class='sc'>Midwifery</span>, because many different Points of the
greatest <i>Importance</i>, are thereby plainly discover’d: But
before I enter upon these Things, I would have it
rightly understood, that nothing else is meant here by
the <i>Performance</i> of the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, than (upon having first
pared the <i>Nails</i> short, equal, and smooth) <i>passing the
two Fore-fingers of either Hand, (previously well anointed
with Fat or Butter, when proper Oils are not to be had)
through the</i> <span class='sc'>Vulva</span> <i>into the</i> <span class='sc'>Vagina</span>, <i>in order to reach the
Orifice of the WOMB</i>, and to discern its <span class='sc'>Form</span>, by feeling
it on each Side.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> it is not only requisite that the Woman in
<span class='sc'>Labour</span> be <i>touched</i>, before her <i>Pains</i> come on, because
then the <i>Membrane</i> containing the <i>Humours</i> being loose,
the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>’s <i>Posture</i> may be the better distinguish’d;
but the same <span class='sc'>Touch</span> also is to be continued during the
<i>Force</i> of the <i>Pains</i>, the better to know their <i>Nature</i> and
<i>Effects</i>; whether the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> continues still at the <i>Passage</i>
or not; and whether the <i>Humours</i> are contracted
<i>length-ways</i>, or press’d into a <i>Flat Form</i>, and the like.
For after the <i>Pains</i> are over, it is easily to be perceiv’d,
whether they have <i>promoted</i> the <span class='sc'>Birth</span> or <i>Not</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> during this <i>Performance</i> of the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, great
Care must be taken not to handle the <i>Membranes</i> containing
the <i>Humours</i> too roughly, lest they should break
in the Action.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> that the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> may the more readily
perform her <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, she must take good Heed to what
is said of the <i>Cavity</i> of the<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c017'><sup>[157]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>: for as it rises from
the <i>Bottom</i> obliquely, ascending forwards; so, upon
this Occasion, in seeking for the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
she must not thrust her <i>Fingers</i> streight along according
to the <i>Length</i> of the Body, towards the bending of the
<span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>; but guide them <i>upwards</i> from the <i>Bottom</i>,
as if thro’ the <span class='sc'>Vagina</span>, she would touch the <i>Navel</i>:
For Thus her <i>Hand</i> being turn’d inward, and her <i>Fingers</i>
tending towards the <i>Navel</i>, the <i>Orifice</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> lying directly in the way, she meets with it
readily at first. Whereas they who go otherways to
work, seek it in vain, and find it with Difficulty.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> Observation I thought the more requisite
in this Place, because <i>MIDWIVES</i> not accurately understanding
the <i>Situation</i> of the <i>Bones</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Pelvis</span></em>,
think that the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and its <i>Neck</i> or <span class='sc'>Vagina</span> reach
according to the <i>Length</i> of the Woman, and make use
of their <i>Hands</i> accordingly: First hurting the <span class='sc'>Vagina</span>
and <span class='sc'>Rectum</span> in the Bending of the <span class='sc'>Sacrum</span>; and then
finding no farther <i>Passage</i> for their <i>Fingers</i>; but being
altogether ignorant of the above-mentioned Method of
finding the said <i>Orifice</i>, they are very often surpriz’d,
fall into great <i>Confusion</i> for want of better <i>Instruction</i>.
Whence I proceed to——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XV.</span><br /> <i>Of the various Uses and Advantages of the <em class='gesperrt'>TOUCH</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>BY</em> the <span class='sc'>Touch</span> then, to be brief, the <i>MIDWIFE</i>
gains the certain <i>Knowledge</i> of the following important
<i>Heads</i>: viz.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em>, Whether a <i>Woman</i> be with <i>CHILD</i> or
not: For I must needs own, that some of the most certain
<i>Signs</i> of <i>Pregnancy</i> are discover’d by the <i>TOUCH</i>;
since the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> shuts itself close up, immediately after
<span class='sc'>Conception</span>, and its <i>Orifice</i> becomes more <i>pointed</i>, <i>hard</i>,
and <i>solid</i>, resembling (according to <i>Mauriceau’s</i> just
Comparison) the <i>Mouth</i> of a <i>Puppy</i> newly pupp’d.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in time of the <i>INFANT</i>’s ripening, this
<i>Orifice</i> begins to <i>swell</i>, and becomes <i>softer</i>, <i>smoother</i>, and
<i>thinner</i> than it was Before.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, The <i>MIDWIFE</i> discovers by the
<i>TOUCH</i>, whether the Time of <span class='sc'>Birth</span> is near at hand,
and how near it is. However, in speaking to this
Point, I desire to be rightly understood, not meaning
<i>Miscarriages</i>, or <i>Illegitimate BIRTHS</i>, but only such as
are intirely <i>Legitimate</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> then the <i>INFANT</i> advances in <i>Maturation</i>, so
the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> from the <i>Third Month</i>, grows
<i>smoother</i>, <i>thinner</i>, and <i>softer</i>; and consequently the more
<i>smooth</i>, <i>thin</i>, and <i>soft</i> it appears at any time afterwards
to the <i>TOUCH</i>, so much the <i>nearer</i> draws on the <i>Time</i>
of <span class='sc'>Birth</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> <i>some Women</i>, this <i>ORIFICE</i> begins to open two
or three <i>Months</i> before <span class='sc'>Birth</span>; and this <i>Aperture</i> enlarging
itself by degrees, becomes soon as wide as a
<i>Shilling-Piece</i>, when the <i>Motion</i> of the <i>INFANT</i> may
be distinctly perceiv’d: And in <i>others</i> it is so much
more enlarged, that one single <i>Pain</i> or two accomplishes
the <span class='sc'>Birth</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> as all <i>Women</i> are not <i>alike</i>, so this <i>RULE</i>
will admit of sundry <i>Exceptions</i>; for <i>strong-body’d</i> Women,
Women of their <i>First Child</i>, and those somewhat
in Years, their <span class='sc'>Wombs</span> continue generally shut up to the
last, and open not without the severest <i>Pains</i>: And
not only so, but the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> differs also, in
all difficult and <i>Preternatural Cases</i>, as well by reason of
its own <i>oblique Situation</i>, as of the <i>INFANT</i>’s ill Posture.
For this Reason it is, that an Experienced and Judicious
<i>Hand</i> is most requisite upon such Occasions;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>since such an <i>One</i> can clearly distinguish, what <i>Another</i>
cannot so much as guess at.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIRDLY</em>, The <i>MIDWIFE</i> immediately knows
by the <i>TOUCH</i>, whether the Woman be taken with the
real and genuine <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Labour-Pains</span></em> or <i>Not</i>. Which is a
Point of the <i>greatest Moment</i>; since as it is of bad Consequence
to <i>delay</i> the <span class='sc'>Birth</span>, when the Woman is so taken,
especially if the <i>WOMB</i> and <i>INFANT</i> be <i>Both</i>
well situated, lest the <i>Pains</i> should vanish, and the Opportunity
of <span class='sc'>Delivery</span> should thereby be lost: so, on
the other hand, to force a Woman to <span class='sc'>Labour</span>, unseasonably,
when but seiz’d with <i>Bastard-Pains</i>, is a most
pernicious Thing.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> both these <i>Cases</i> too often happen, even to the
<i>Hazard</i>, if not the <i>Loss</i> also of both <span class='sc'>Lives</span>; especially
the <i>Latter</i>, when the <i>MIDWIFE</i> does not know how to
distinguish these <i>False Pains</i>, either the <i>Cholick</i>, or other
<i>Gripes</i>, from the <i>genuine Pains</i> by the <i>TOUCH</i>: As will
be more fully and amply explain’d in the next following
<i>Chapter</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>GIVE</em> me Leave to say then, that <span class='sc'>Birth</span> is not to
be provok’d by any Means, until the <i>MIDWIFE</i>, by
touching the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, is certain, that the
Woman labours under the <i>True Pains</i>; which is not to
be judiciously suppos’d to happen before the <i>Seventh
Month</i> at soonest.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'><i>BIRTH</i></em> at that Time approaching, the Woman is
afflicted with great <span class='sc'>Pains</span> in her <i>Groin</i>, <i>Loins</i>, and about
the <i>Navel</i>, tending downwards with a depressing
Force upon the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and other <i>Private Parts</i>. But
these <span class='sc'>Pains</span> are not continual, for they only go-off and
come-on by <i>turns</i>; at which Time, by their violent <i>Depressure</i>,
the <i>MIDWIFE</i> finds the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
<i>open</i>, or at least <i>opening</i>, and upon Renewal of the <span class='sc'>Pain</span>,
she finds it more and more dilated and relaxed: whereas,
on the other hand, when the <span class='sc'>Pains</span> are <i>Spurious</i>,
they disperse themselves through the whole <i>Body</i>, as
well as the <i>Abdomen</i>; and then the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> (as if it
were securing itself) is found more closely <i>contracted</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span><em class='gesperrt'>FOURTHLY</em>, It is likewise well known by the
<i>TOUCH</i>, whether the <span class='sc'>Birth</span> will be <i>Easy</i> and <i>Speedy</i>, or
<i>Difficult</i> and <i>Lingring</i>, on several Occasions: 1. When
the <i>MIDWIFE</i> finds the <i>Head</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> and the
lower Part of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> fallen into the <i>Cavity</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, so that <i>She</i> can touch it in the Confines of the
<span class='sc'>Vagina</span>: 2. When the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is very
soft, thin, and wide-open, so that (through it) she
finds the <i>Head</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> foremost, without any
Obstruction by the <i>Arms</i> or <i>Umbilical Vessels</i> in the way,
between the <i>Head</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, and <i>Orifice</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>; as often happens: And, 3. When the <i>Humours</i>,
by the <i>right Situation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>,
are found compressed into a <i>Flat Form</i>. I say,
when Matters are found so (by the <i>TOUCH</i>) in this
<i>Natural Posture</i>, there is no great doubt (under GOD)
of a <i>Speedy</i> and <i>Easy</i> <span class='sc'>Delivery</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREAS</em>, on the contrary, when the <i>Orifice</i> is
found by Experience <i>higher</i>, <i>little</i> or not at all <i>open</i>;
<i>sharp</i>, <i>hard</i>, and <i>thick</i>, with the <i>Humours</i> pressed up
length-ways: <i>Then</i> the <i>Case</i> is quite revers’d, and the
<i>MIDWIFE</i>, if she <i>understands</i> her Business, must resolve
to <i>sweat at her Work</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> the Reason of such <i>Difficult</i> <span class='sc'>Births</span> commonly
proceeds, either from the <i>wrong Situation</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Infant</span>, or <i>That</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; the <i>latter</i> of which always
occasions the greater <i>Difficulty</i>, especially when it
is accidentally join’d with the <i>First</i>, to a vast Degree of
<i>Aggravation</i>: Of which, as follows of course.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIFTHLY</em>, Another <i>Advantage</i> of the <i>TOUCH</i>, is
the truly Knowing whether the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> be in a <i>Natural</i>,
or <i>Preternatural Posture</i>. For the <i>MIDWIFE</i> finding the
<i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> so <i>open</i>, that it admits one or two
<i>Fingers</i>, she may distinctly feel the <i>Chin</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>
in a <i>Natural Position</i>, lying forwards on its <i>Breast</i>, and
the <i>Neck</i> in the <i>Middle</i> of the <i>Orifice</i>, or streight <i>Before</i>
it; so that the <i>Head</i> being foremost and lowest within
the Borders of the <i>Orifice</i>, the <i>Fingers</i> cannot pass any
<i>Farther</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, supposing the <i>Clunes</i>, <i>Knee</i>, or
<i>Elbow</i>, to present themselves <i>First</i> in the <i>ORIFICE</i>; It
is true, they have their <i>Roundness</i>, but then they are
easily distinguished from the <i>Head</i>: For the <i>Globular
Part</i> of it is much <i>broader</i> and <i>smoother</i>, than either <i>Knee</i>
or <i>Elbow</i>, and <i>harder</i> than the <i>Buttocks</i>; which <i>Fleshy
Part</i> is soon distinguished from the <i>Bones</i>, or the <i>soft
Membrane</i> betwixt the <i>Bones</i> of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> as a capable <i>MIDWIFE</i> can hereby distinguish
all <i>These</i> with Facility, even before the <i>Waters</i>
begin to flow; so I need not mention the <i>Hands</i>, which
distinguish themselves by the <i>Fingers</i>, as the <i>Feet</i> do,
by the <i>Toes</i> or <i>Heels</i>; and the <i>Navel-string</i> discovers itself
by its <i>Softness</i>, <i>Thinness</i>, and <i>Roundness</i>: All which,
however yet, are more easily known when the <i>Membrane</i>
is broke, and the <i>Waters</i> have actually flown. For
the <i>Parts</i>, which were before covered with this <i>Membrane</i>,
lie now naked in the <em class='gesperrt'><i>ORIFICE</i></em>: Hence it
often unluckily happens, that <i>few MIDWIVES</i> make
an exact <i>Scrutiny</i>, about the <i>Situation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>,
till this Time of <span class='sc'>Flooding</span>; erroneously thinking they
are then <i>soon</i> enough, which is an unaccountable Mistake;
as will hereafter abundantly appear.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SIXTHLY</em>, It is perfectly known by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>,
whether the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> be in a <i>Natural</i> or <i>Preternatural
Posture</i>, as is plainly taught more at large in the foregoing
<i>Chapter</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FINALLY</em>, in short, we most assuredly know
by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, what is proper to be done in all <i>Preternatural
Cases</i>, upon giving <i>Assistance</i> both to the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>
and <span class='sc'>Infant</span>; as hereafter will fully appear by a
more copious <i>Dissertation</i> to that Purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP</em>. XVI.</span><br /> <i>Of the Genuine and Spurious <em class='gesperrt'>LABOUR-PAINS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> sole Reason I add this <i>Chapter</i>, is, because
our common <i>MIDWIVES</i> are so often mistaken,
and do so frequently err in this <i>Point</i>, having no thorough-pac’d
<i>Knowledge</i> of either sort of these <i>PAINS</i>:
For when she comes to a Woman, taken ill with severe
<em class='gesperrt'><i>PAINS</i></em> in the <i>Belly</i> or <i>Loins</i>, being ignorant of the
accurate Nicety of the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, she presently concludes
<i>These</i> to be the true <i>labouring <em class='gesperrt'>PAINS</em></i>, because they
indeed often resemble them very much; and she farther
finding perhaps the <i>ORIFICE</i> a little <i>relax’d</i> and <i>open</i>,
expects it to enlarge to her Satisfaction. Which, however,
not answering her Hopes, nor the <i>PAINS</i> encreasing;
she endeavours by <i>stimulating Medicines</i> and other
sinistrous <i>Means</i>, conformable to the perverse <i>Rules</i>
of her <span class='sc'>Practice</span>, to raise and provoke <i>Them</i>: So that
this, in short, is the <i>Cause</i>, not only of many an <i>untimely
BIRTH</i>, but also too commonly of many an <i>untimely
DEATH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> the <i>Wind-Cholick</i>, either in the Lower or
Upper Part of the <i>Belly</i>, occasions frequent racking
<i>PAINS</i>, as do also the <span class='sc'>Humours</span> by Virtue of their
<i>Acidity</i>, corroding the <i>Intestines</i>; and these <i>Mordacious
PAINS</i> are generally attended with a subsequent <i>Looseness</i>.
In which <i>Cases</i>, I always use proper <i>mitigating</i>
and <i>repelling</i> <span class='sc'>Means</span>, (such as a <i>Carminative</i> and <i>Emollient
Clyster</i>, &amp;c: upon extreme Occasions); which proper
<i>Means</i> infallibly answer my Ends in either Condition.
For if the <i>PAINS</i> that afflict the Woman are
<i>Spurious</i>, They are thereby suddenly <i>laid</i> and repressed;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and if <i>Genuine</i>, These very self-same <i>Means</i> most effectually
promote and advance <i>them</i> to <i>BIRTH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> again, <i>some Women</i> are taken with a mix’d
Complication of <i>Genuine</i> and <i>Spurious</i>, or <i>Real</i> and <i>False
PAINS</i>, that are properly called <i>Tergiversant</i>; which
one Moment seem to <i>depress</i> the <i>BIRTH</i>, and <i>encourage</i>
the Woman to <span class='sc'>Labour</span>; and the next convert themselves
into scatter’d <span class='sc'>Cramps</span>, and other contracting
<i>PAINS</i>: And these dispersed <i>Bastard-Pains</i> are always
more pernicious to the Woman, than the most severe
<i>natural</i> <span class='sc'>Labour-Pains</span>: <i>This Case</i> is also easily distinguished
by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>; which done, the <i>false wandring
Pains</i> are first to be assuag’d or carry’d off, before the
<i>BIRTH</i> can well succeed.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em>, as to the real <i>Natural</i> and <i>Genuine Pains</i>,
They are, (methinks) in short, easily to be judged of
by the <i>Manner</i> in which they always seize the <i>Woman</i>;
viz.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> the <i>Navel</i> downwards to the <i>Groin</i>, reflecting
towards the <i>Loins</i>, with a depressing and bearing
down upon the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and <span class='sc'>Privities</span>, as occasionally
mentioned in the preceding <i>Chapter</i>: And tho’ <i>These</i>
are intermitting (not <i>continual</i>) <i>PAINS</i>, yet their Severity
and Violence extenuate the <i>Umbilical</i>, and protuberate
the <i>Genital Parts</i>, opening and distending the
<i>Passages</i>. But besides, as the <i>Blood</i> is exagitated and
fermented, it excites a Velocity of <span class='sc'>Pulse</span>, and a <i>Redness
of Face</i>; whilst the <span class='sc'>Belly</span> waxes <i>Fiery-hot</i>, and a
<i>Feverish Shivering</i> or <i>Trembling-Fit</i> invades the <i>whole Woman</i>,
especially the inferiour <span class='sc'>Limbs</span>, but without any
<i>Frigidity</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Membranes</i>, with their <i>Contents</i>, which
<i>MIDWIVES</i> commonly call the <i>Gathering of the Waters</i>,
now present themselves at the <i>Orifice</i> before the <i>Head</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, resembling (to the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>) <i>Abortive Eggs</i>
without any <span class='sc'>Shell</span>: upon <i>These</i> breaking, the <i>Waters</i>
begin to flow; at first more <i>Sparingly</i>, but by and by
more <i>profusely</i>, and at last a <i>waterish Blood</i> follows, when
a <i>GIRL</i> is to be born; or a <i>pure-colour’d Blood</i>, when a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span><i>BOY</i>: But I also farther distinguish the <i>BIRTH</i> of an
approaching <i>BOY</i> from <i>that</i> of a <i>GIRL</i>, by the <i>Labour-Pains</i>;
for in the <i>first Case</i>, these are far more severe and
penetrating, and accordingly the <i>BIRTH</i> much more
expeditious, than in <i>Case</i> of a <i>GIRL</i>: In which (however)
the <i>PAINS</i> are more constant and regular.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> now, at last, the <i>OSSA COCCYGIS</i> and
<i>COXENDICIS</i> begin to yield, and give way; while the
<i>Bottom</i> contracts, the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> opens, and the
<span class='sc'>Vagina</span> dilates itself fully: So that <i>now</i>, and not <i>before</i>,
most of the abovesaid <i>Signs</i> evidently appear, I
give my patient <i>Woman</i> the <span class='sc'>Word</span> to <i>Labour her best</i>;
because if she begins <i>sooner</i>, she too much debilitates
both <i>Herself</i> and fatigues the <em class='gesperrt'><i>CHILD</i></em> before its due
Time.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, I have seen <i>some Women</i> in <span class='sc'>Labour</span>
taken with a sudden <i>Vomiting</i>, that I suppose proceeded
from the <i>natural Sympathy</i>, which the <span class='sc'>Stomach</span>
bears to the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>: Whereupon it discharges a certain
<i>Viscous Matter</i>, which I have always observ’d, upon its
turning <i>Bloody</i>, to presage an easy <i>LABOUR</i>, and an expeditious
<i>DELIVERY</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FARTHER</em> yet, the <i>MIDWIFE</i> must always
remember, that when the commenced <i>real PAINS</i> of
<i>Labour</i> chance to cease, the Woman’s <i>Labouring Efforts</i>
must also terminate with them in Course: And as this
<i>Case</i> denotes a <i>Debility</i> of the <i>Expulsive Faculty</i>; so if it
be not both <i>Timely</i> and <i>Judiciously</i> assisted, It may prove
of the worst of Consequences. In a word, so much I
have thought previously <i>necessary</i> to my Purpose, before
I enter upon——</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> this Occasion, the <i>MIDWIFE</i> ought, in
the <i>first place</i>, carefully to observe the <span class='sc'>Contents</span>
of the foregoing <i>Chapter</i>; and, <i>Secondly</i>, To follow this
general <span class='sc'>Rule</span>, which I lay down out of absolute <i>Necessity</i>:
viz. <i>That the Woman be delivered, and the Child

and <i>that</i> because the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> immediately, after
<i>This</i> is over, falls, shrinks, and contracts itself again,
and of Consequence compresses the <em class='gesperrt'><i>BIRTH</i></em> very
closely.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in order to effect <i>this</i> Matter, as much depends
upon the right <i>Situation</i> or <i>Placing</i> of the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>;
so I advise, in the first place, that, as soon as the <span class='sc'>Waters</span>
begin to flow, <i>She</i> be commodiously <i>placed</i> either
in a <span class='sc'>Bed</span>, <span class='sc'>Chair</span>, or <span class='sc'>Stool</span>, properly adapted for that
Purpose, and <i>laid</i> with great Skill and Judgment, not
too <i>Supine</i>, nor altogether <i>Upright</i>; but (as it were)
between a <i>standing</i> and <i>lying Posture</i>: having her <i>Back</i> a
little erected for the freer <i>Respiration</i>, and the better
<span class='sc'>Labour</span>; with her <i>Thighs</i> at a due Liberty and Distance,
only separated as much as possibly they may;
her <i>Knees</i> a little elevated; her <i>Feet</i> stayed against something
<i>Firm</i>, and her <i>Heels</i> bending <i>Backwards</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> I must farther observe in this
place, that the <i>POSITIONS</i> of <i>parturient Women</i> are
very various and different; <i>some</i> doing this <i>Work</i> (as
above) in a <i>Bed</i>, <i>others</i> in a <i>Stool</i>, and <i>some</i> again I have
seen deliver’d <i>standing</i>, and <i>leaning</i> only a little <i>Forwards</i>
upon the <i>Bed-stead</i>. Hence, I say, that the <i>POSTURES</i>
in time of <span class='sc'>Labour</span>, differ not only according to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span><i>Necessity</i>, but also sometimes (in <i>Natural Easy Cases</i>)
according to the <i>Custom</i> of the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BE</em> that as it will, I would advise all <i>Labouring
Women</i>, FIRST to make <i>Choice</i> of a dextrous and ingenious
<i>MIDWIFE</i> to attend them at that <i>critical Juncture</i>,
since the poetical <i>Proverb</i> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Accidit in puncto, quod
non speratur in Anno</span></i>) holds as True in <i>BIRTH</i> as in any
<i>Case</i> I know; for <i>some Women</i> after having sundry
repeated Natural easy <i>BIRTHS</i>, come at last to suffer
by some difficult or <i>preternatural Accident</i>, which may
happen in a <i>Moment of Time</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, I would advise all <i>parturient
Women</i>, to give themselves over into the Hands of such
a <i>MIDWIFE</i>, to be universally <i>advised</i> and <i>entirely</i> directed
by her Conduct: And thus being under the
watchful <i>Eye</i> and diligent <i>Care</i> of the prudent and
skilful <i>MIDWIFE</i>, the good <i>Woman in her Travail</i> has
Nothing else to do (besides following <i>Instruction</i>) but
only to assume <i>Courage</i> and <i>Resolution</i> to assist her own
<i>PAINS</i> as she feels them coming on, by <i>drawing</i> and
<i>holding</i> her <span class='sc'>Breath</span>, as if she was to <i>sob</i> or <i>sigh</i>, by
contracting the <i>MUSCLES</i> of her <i>Belly</i>, as much as
possible; insomuch that the forcible <i>Impression</i> may bear
alike upon each side of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and depress the
<i>Diaphragma</i>, which (of Consequence) suppresses the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>. But then again in this <i>Case</i> I would observe
briefly, that she is strictly to regard the <i>TIME</i> of a <i>right
true Travail, as at that Juncture</i> only to use <i>these</i> her
best and strongest <i>Endeavours</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> now to return to the <i>Duty</i> of the attending
<i>MIDWIFE</i>; as occasion requires, She is to direct her
<span class='sc'>Woman</span>, either to <i>lie</i>, <i>sit</i>, <i>stand</i>, or <i>walk</i>, keeping her
always <i>Warm</i>, and as close <i>cover’d</i> in Time of <span class='sc'>Touching</span>
as possible; for the least Breath almost of <i>Cold Air</i> may
occasion <i>Convulsions</i>, and <i>other</i> most dangerous <i>Accidents</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BECAUSE</em> I have often observ’d <i>Women</i> to be
<i>Costive</i> and bound in their <i>Bellys</i> upon this Occasion,
which is of dangerous Consequence, I would therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>advise in this <i>Case</i> to adhibite a gentle <i>Emollient Clyster</i>;
not only that (by the <span class='sc'>Rectum</span> being so emptied) there
may be the more <i>Room</i> for the necessary <i>Dilatation</i> of
the <i>PARTS</i>, but also that the unfortunate <i>Effects</i> of
<span class='sc'>Costiveness</span> may be timely prevented: And the
same <i>Means</i> I would use, in Case of <i>Heavy</i>, <i>Dull</i>, or
<i>Languid PAINS</i>; ordering the <i>Clyster</i> only in this <i>Case</i>
to be made a little more <i>Carminative</i>; as mentioned in
the preceeding <i>Chapter</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> <i>this</i> however I would have done in the <i>Beginning</i>
of the <i>Travail</i>, and reiterated (if need so require)
before the <i>CHILD</i> be advanced too far <i>Forwards</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> the <i>MIDWIFE</i> finding all things in a <i>Natural
Posture</i>, and the <span class='sc'>Child</span> in a <i>Forward way</i>, is to advance
her <i>Hand</i> skilfully, (which at every individual
<span class='sc'>Touch</span> ought to be fresh-anointed with the <i>Oil</i> of
white <i>Lillies</i>, <i>Roses</i>, &amp;c. or <i>Fresh-Butter</i>, <i>Hogs-Lard</i>, or
whatsoever of this Nature is readiest at Hand) entering
the <i>ORIFICE</i> with the <i>Fingers-Ends</i>, dilating it by
opening <i>them</i> gently as the <span class='sc'>Pains</span> come on: Thrusting
gradually the <i>Sides</i> of the <i>ORIFICE</i> towards the
<i>OCCIPUT</i> or Hinder part of the <span class='sc'>Child’s</span> Head, and
moistening these <i>Passages</i> also with what she uses for her
<i>Hands</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEN</em> the <i>VERTEX</i>, or <i>Crown of the Head</i>, appears
without the <i>Privities</i>, the <i>MIDWIFE</i> most commonly
calls out or says the <span class='sc'>Child</span> is in the <i>Passage</i>;
and the <i>parturient Woman</i> then finding these Parts (as it
were) scratch’d or prick’d with <span class='sc'>Pins</span>, often groundlessly
imagines that her <i>MIDWIFE</i> deals roughly by
<i>Her</i> with <i>Nails</i> and <i>Fingers</i>; whereas that <i>Pungency</i> is
only occasioned by a violent <i>Distension</i>, or perhaps a
<i>Laceration</i>, sometimes inevitably made, by the <span class='sc'>Bulk</span> of
the <i>Head</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> that be, and whatever the <i>Woman</i>
may think or say, the <i>MIDWIFE</i> is only to mind her
own Business, and discharge her Duty faithfully upon
this <i>CRISIS</i>; in order to which, it is now High Time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>that she also place herself in a convenient <i>Posture</i> to receive
the <i>BIRTH</i>: Which (when advanced as far as
the <i>EARS</i>, or <i>thereabouts</i>) she is to take gentle hold of,
by <i>both Sides</i> of the <i>HEAD</i> with <i>both Hands</i>; so that by
this <i>Means</i> she may be ready and able, against the first
<i>Onset</i> of the next good <span class='sc'>Pain</span>, to draw forth the <span class='sc'>Child</span>.
In doing whereof, she must take special <i>Care</i> that the
<i>NAVEL-STRING</i> be not entangled about the <i>Neck</i>,
or any other <i>Part</i>, lest the <i>Secundine</i> or the <i>Womb</i> itself
thereby suffer Violence, and consequently cause either
<i>Flooding</i>, or break the <i>String</i>, which may render the
<i>Case</i> dangerous and the <i>BIRTH</i> difficult.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in thus attracting the <i>INFANT</i>, the <i>MIDWIFE</i>
must carefully observe, not to draw the <i>HEAD</i>
straight-forwards, but move it gently from <i>Side to Side</i>,
that the <i>Shoulders</i> may the more readily and easily take
Place: For <i>these</i> must immediately follow the <i>HEAD</i>
without <i>Loss of Time</i>, otherways the <i>BIRTH</i> may be
strangled in the <i>Passage</i> by the <i>WOMB</i> shutting upon
its <i>Neck</i>: To prevent which <i>Tragical Catastrophe</i>, the
Cunning Expert <i>MIDWIFE</i> directly slides in her
<i>Fingers</i> under the <i>Arm-Pitts</i>, and then draws discreetly
the <i>BODY</i> forth without any Difficulty or Danger.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>THUS</i>, in fine, We have discreetly deliver’d our
good <i>WOMAN</i>, in <i>Case</i> of a <i>Natural Easy Birth</i>; but
on the other Side, in difficult and <i>Preternatural Cases</i>,
the several Conditions and Circumstances will mightily
differ from the Beginning; because in <i>these</i> the <i>PAINS</i>
are not always sufficient to produce the <i>BIRTH</i>.
Hence it is sometimes more convenient for the
<i>WOMAN</i> to be <i>Passive</i>, rather than <i>Active</i>; especially
when the <span class='sc'>Position</span> of either the <i>Womb</i>, or the <i>Infant</i>
is <i>Preternatural</i>: For then it is the <i>MIDWIFE’s</i> whole
Business to <i>labour</i> more than the <i>WOMAN</i>; then her
ingenious <span class='sc'>Touch</span> is of infinite Service to the <i>PARTURIENT</i>,
since by that only she can distinguish the
Degree of the <i>Ill Situation</i> whether of the <i>CHILD</i> or the
<i>WOMB</i>. Which being dextrously done, <i>She</i> is in the next
Place, prudently to consider what kind of <i>POSTURE</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span><i>Sitting</i> or <i>Lying</i>, is most convenient, that she may the
<i>better</i> discharge her own good <i>Office</i> and <i>Duty</i>: Of which
I shall treat more particularly in the following respective
<i>Chapters</i>; since it still remains here, by the way,
that we also deliver our above-mentioned <i>Woman</i> of her
<span class='sc'>After-Birth</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XVIII.</span><br /> <i>Of the Method of Extracting the <em class='gesperrt'>SECUNDINE</em></i>,</h3>
<p class='c019'>&amp;c.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>AFTER</em> all, to perfect or finish the <i>Woman’s
DELIVERY</i>, it still remains that <i>She</i> be freed of
her <span class='sc'>After-Birth</span>, or <span class='sc'>Secundine</span>. Now this I advise
to be done with all imaginable Speed, after the <span class='sc'>Child</span>
<i>is born</i>, even before the <i>NAVEL-STRING</i> is cut: Because
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> immediately <i>contracts</i> itself, so that
<i>This</i> cannot be accomplish’d afterwards without great
<i>Difficulty</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, I know beforehand, that my Method
of performing this Work, which I am about to lay
down, will be thought a strange <i>Innovation</i> in <i>Midwifery</i>;
but without any regard to that, in speaking to
this <i>Point</i>, I shall <i>First</i> suppose this <i>Body</i> to be already
loosen’d from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; in which <i>Case</i> the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span>
has nothing to do, but to draw the <i>STRING</i> gently,
which she holds in <i>One Hand</i>, twisted twice or thrice
around one or more of her <i>Fingers</i>, while she passes the
<i>Other Hand</i> into the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, following always the
<i>STRING</i> (as her <i>Guide</i>) to the Place where the <span class='sc'>Burthen</span>
lies: And where, as in this <i>Case</i>, it naturally
presents itself to the <span class='sc'>Orifice</span>, <i>She</i> stretches her <i>Hand</i>
up length-ways, taking hold of it betwixt her <i>Fingers</i>;
and thus, by the Assistance of the <i>other Hand</i> always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>attracting softly the <i>STRING</i>, she brings it at last
most commodiously away.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, I shall suppose, in the mean Time,
this <i>Body</i> to continue <i>fixed</i> to the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, either in <i>Part</i>
or in <i>Whole</i>: In which <i>Case</i>, if in <i>Part</i>, the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span>
finding by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span> the other <i>Loose Part</i>, moves her
<i>Hand thither</i> betwixt <i>That</i> and the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, shaking or
stirring it gently <i>backwards</i> and <i>forwards</i>, until such
time as it is entirely <i>loosen’d</i>, when she proceeds as <i>Before</i>:
But if in <i>whole</i>, and that it sticks very <i>Fast</i>, then
the <i>MIDWIFE</i> places her <i>Hindmost Fingers</i> on its <i>Exteriour
Part</i> against the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and her <i>Fore-Fingers</i> against
the <i>Inside</i>; so that thus by pulling softly on all <i>Sides</i>
quite round, it is easily <i>loosen’d</i> and <i>extracted</i> as Above.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIRDLY</em>, I shall suppose this <i>SECUNDINE</i>
also (tho’ loosen’d successfully) to be so very <i>Large</i>,
that it cannot pass through the <i>ORIFICE</i>: In this
<i>Case</i>, I only desire my <i>deliver’d Woman</i> to concur with
me, and behave herself as if she was forcing or expelling
the <i>CHILD</i>; for then whilst I at the same time
gently attract the <i>STRING</i>, it immediately follows.</p>

<p class='c005'>I very well know that Mr. <i>Mauriceau</i> and all <i>others</i>
either <i>in</i> and <i>before</i> his Time, teach quite different <i>Methods</i>
of extruding the <i>AFTER-BIRTH</i>; such as are
by the <i>WOMAN’s blowing in her Fist, putting her Finger
in her Throat, and the like</i>; which when the <i>poor Patient</i>
has done, and stood them All out <i>ineffectually</i>, together
with their many other various <i>uncertain Experiments</i> to
no <i>Purpose</i>, and none of them have succeeded (as it
has often happen’d): Then at last, and not till then,
they direct the aforesaid <i>Method</i> of the <i>HAND</i> to be
used. But now-a-days, we know better Things than
to run such indiscreet <i>Risques</i>, when we may go a safer
Way to work; or to make use of <i>Uncertainties</i>, when
we know more <i>Infallible Means</i>. As I shall, I hope,
make this <i>Method</i> plainly appear to be; notwithstanding
all the great <i>Cautions</i> of those Authors publish’d,
and the Difficulties they make of it in our Practice of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span><i>MIDWIFERY</i>: And that I will endeavour to do
from the following <i>Considerations</i>, viz.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> after the <span class='sc'>Birth</span> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, the <i>Hand</i> be
presently pass’d into the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, it slips in together
with Part of the <i>Arm</i>, as far as is needful, without the
least <i>Trouble</i> or <i>Inconvenience</i> to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span>; the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
as well as its <span class='sc'>Orifice</span> continuing always, so long as
<i>this</i> may be done, sufficiently <i>Open</i>: And thus the
<span class='sc'>Birth</span> maybe skilfully accomplished or perfected, as
it were, in an <i>Instant</i>; while <i>others</i> (trying their vain
<i>Projects</i>) spend many trifling <i>Hours</i> about it, and it is
<i>ten to one</i>, if at last they succeed.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>BY</em> these means, moreover, I presently know
whether there be <i>One</i>, <i>Another</i>, or <i>More INFANTS</i> to
follow; whether there be a <i>dead CHILD</i>, <i>false CONCEPTION</i>,
or any <i>Foreign Body</i> whatsoever, lodged in
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; whether any <i>Part</i>, or <i>Pieces</i> of the <span class='sc'>Secundine</span>,
or <i>Membranes</i>, or <i>Lumps</i> of <i>Clotted Blood</i>, be left
behind and retain’d: All which I propose to bring away
either <i>before</i>, or <i>after</i> the <span class='sc'>Secundine</span>, as Occasion
serves, with the greatest <i>Safety</i> as well as <i>Expedition</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>AFTER</em> having thoroughly searched on all
<i>Sides</i>, and thus duly cleans’d the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, by continuing
my <i>Hand</i> in it, until it contracts about that <i>Hand</i>,
first <i>above</i> towards the <i>Bottom</i>, and then <i>below</i> towards
the <i>Orifice</i>, which happens very quickly: I
find myself <i>then</i>, by great Experience, able to rectify
all <i>Oblique</i> and <i>Preternatural Situations</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>;
as in <i>Case</i> of a <span class='sc'>Prolapsus</span>, (or <i>Falling down</i>) I can
hereby move it carefully <i>Up</i> again: If it lies too
much <i>Backwards</i>, by elevating it while it gradually
contracts, I can easily bring it <i>Forwards</i>, to its <i>Natural
Position</i>: If it hangs too much <i>Forwards</i>, I can
quickly reduce it <i>Backwards</i>: If it tends to <i>either Side</i>,
I can directly move it to its Center. And thus, in
short, I hope I may be allow’d gently and gradually to
restore the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> to its <i>Natural Place</i> and <i>Posture</i>, how
<i>Preternaturally</i> and <i>Obliquely</i> soever its <i>Situation</i> may happen
to be disorder’d.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> This being so successfully done, I can, in
fine, assure and secure any <i>Lying-in-Woman</i>, that her
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> is both duly <i>purg’d</i>, and naturally <i>shut</i> again as it
ought to be; which I take to be the greatest <i>Satisfaction</i>
the <span class='sc'>Child-Bed-Woman</span> can conceive in her Condition.
Whereas,</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>THEY</em> who leave all these Things to mere
<span class='sc'>Nature</span>, risque their <span class='sc'>Patient’s</span> future <i>Welfare</i>, and
very often her <i>Life</i> too, as innumerable <i>Tragical Examples</i>
witness: For <span class='sc'>Nature</span> itself most particularly
requires our special <i>Assistance</i> in this <i>Case</i>. But (according
to their indifferent <i>Notions</i>) it is <i>Time</i> enough to assist
<span class='sc'>Nature</span>, when it is found <i>Deficient</i>; and then, in <i>Case</i> of
<span class='sc'>Extremity</span>, they unanimously agree that there is no
other way to help or save the <i>Woman’s</i> <span class='sc'>Life</span>, but by
this <span class='sc'>Method</span> of <i>Manual Operation</i>. To which I answer,
that <span class='sc'>Nature</span> operates not in an <i>Instant</i>, but (in
all <i>Cases</i>) requires a competent <i>Time</i>, to discharge its
respective <i>Functions</i>; and being left too long to itself,
for want of Help, is many a-time (by intervening <i>Accidents</i>)
found at last <i>Incapable</i>: Upon which, then <i>They</i>,
beginning their Endeavours to <i>second it</i>, generally come
too late. For if the <i>Case</i> does not prove to be past all
<i>Remedy</i>, it is at least (by this <i>Protraction of Time</i>) often
rendred not only <i>difficult</i>, but also <i>desperate</i>; as will evidently
appear in the <i>Case in hand</i>, from what follows,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>WHILE</em> <i>They</i> (conformable to the general and
universal <i>Practice</i> of common <i>MIDWIVES</i>) expect the
<i>Performance</i> of <span class='sc'>Nature</span>, or the <i>Success</i> of their <i>trifling
Means</i>, in the mean time, the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is so
<i>closely shut up</i>, that in the space of an Hour or two, it
cannot be <i>penetrated</i>, without renovating the most severe
racking <span class='sc'>Pains</span> to the <i>Woman</i>, who (perhaps) has
been sufficiently spent before, by the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Delivery</em></span> of
her <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>, and is <i>now</i> consequently incapable of
standing out the renew’d <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pangs</em></span>: whereby of course
<i>She</i> must succumb at last, and <i>give up</i> the <i>Ghost</i>, for
want of <i>Timely Help</i>; as innumerable <i>Instances</i> confirm
for an undeniable Truth. But,</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>II. <em class='gesperrt'>SUPPOSING</em> the <i>Woman</i> to be able to
undergo the <i>PAINS</i>, yet the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is however contracted,
and the <i>SECUNDINE</i> bound so close up, that
this <i>Body</i>, which before adher’d <i>Cake-ways</i> to its <i>Bottom</i>
in a <i>smooth</i> and <i>broad Form</i>, is now so squeez’d into a
<i>small</i> and <i>long Figure</i>, that it is even now a <i>Difficulty</i>
next to Impossible, to reach the <i>Bottom</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
and still a <i>harder Task</i> to extract an entire <i>Secundine</i>,
without prejudicing the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>THEY</em> who altogether neglect <i>Manual Operation</i>,
may (I confess) sometimes <i>deliver</i> their <span class='sc'>Woman</span>,
when <i>Success</i> accidentally answers their <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Wish</em></span>: But
without this <i>Mean</i>, they cannot possibly restore a <i>prolaps’d</i>,
<i>fallen-down</i>, or an <i>obliquely situated</i> <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, to its
<i>natural Position</i>. No, to the Contrary, Nothing is
more common among ignorant unwary <i>MIDWIVES</i>,
than to <i>invert</i> and <i>draw down</i> the <i>Bottom</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
itself, by pulling the <i>Navel-String</i>, as they foolishly intend
by <i>means</i> of it only to extract the <i>SECUNDINE</i>.
Neither does the <i>Mischief</i> always end here, but mistaking
this <i>Body</i>, when so found by their <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, they
immediately imagine it to be the <i>Head</i> of another <span class='sc'>Infant</span>;
and persevering in this <i>false Conjecture</i>, they
manifestly expose the poor <span class='sc'>Woman</span> to the Hazard of
her <i>Life</i>. Neither,</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>POSSIBLY</em> can <i>They</i>, without the <i>Use</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Hand</span>, so cleanse the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> of the <i>Reliques</i> of the <i>SECUNDINE</i>,
which may stick up and down to the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>; or of the <i>Pieces</i> or <i>Parts</i> of the <i>Membranes</i>,
which may remain there; or of the <i>clotted Blood</i>, which
commonly stays behind. From hence therefore it necessarily
follows, that (without the <i>Means</i> of the <span class='sc'>Hand</span>)
<i>They</i> cannot be Positive or Certain in any <i>Circumstance</i>,
relating to the <i>True State of the Woman</i>. <i>They</i> can
neither assure Herself, nor those concern’d, that her
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> is duly purged; if (perchance) of the <i>SECUNDINE</i>,
which they may guess at by the <i>Sight</i>, yet not
of the <i>Fragments</i> of the <i>Membranes</i>, nor of the <i>clotted
Blood</i>, which they can never be certain of, but by this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span><span class='sc'>Method</span>. I mention these <i>Things</i>, because the <i>least Part</i>
of <span class='sc'>Either</span> being retain’d, or left <i>Behind</i> in the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
may cost the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> her <i>Life</i>, as innumerable <i>Precedents</i>
do testify. Nor,</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>CAN</em> they possibly secure the <i>Woman</i>, that her
<i>WOMB</i> is <i>duly shut and contracted</i>; much less can they
(without these <i>Means</i>) affirm that it is orderly <i>situated</i>
in its <i>proper natural</i> <span class='sc'>Center</span>: By the Neglect or Fault
of which <i>Condition</i>, she is not only rendred <i>Barren</i> afterwards,
but also most infirm all the Days of her
<i>Life</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> notwithstanding how <i>plain</i> and <i>easy</i> soever, I
have endeavour’d to make out the above-mention’d
<span class='sc'>Method</span>, I would over and above recommend <i>It</i> only
to the <i>judicious</i> and <i>well-qualify’d MIDWIFE</i>; by no
Means to those that are <i>ignorant</i> in the <i>Parts</i> of <i>GENERATION</i>,
nor to any <i>stiff clumsy-fisted Person</i>: And
that for the <i>Two following Reasons</i>; viz.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>LEST</em> the <span class='sc'>String</span> (by some <i>Accident</i> or other)
should break, and she, missing this <i>Guide</i> to the <i>SECUNDINE</i>,
should take <i>One Part</i> for <i>Another</i>, and consequently
<i>dislodge</i> the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> instead of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>After-Birth</em></span>;
which has undoubtedly often happen’d by
such blind <span class='sc'>Doings</span>, notwithstanding this very remarkable
<i>Difference</i> between <i>Them</i>, that the <i>SECUNDINE</i>
distinguishes itself from the <i>Other</i>, by a great many little

<em class='gesperrt'>MAN</em>’s appointed Time may as reasonably
allude to his <i>BIRTH</i>, as to his <i>DEATH</i>:
His <i>Days</i> and his <i>Months</i> (mentioned by
holy <span class='sc'>Job</span><a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c017'><sup>[158]</sup></a>) being as much determin’d, <i>naturally</i>
speaking, in the <i>One</i>, as in the
<i>other Case</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE <i>INFANT</i></em> thus being thoroughly ripen’d,
and arrived to full <i>Perfection</i> of <span class='sc'>Maturity</span>, the <i>Hour</i>
approaches, in which it scorns any longer <i>Confinement</i> to
such narrow Bounds. For the <i>Animal Spirits</i> being discontented,
for want of due <i>Liberty</i> and free <i>Motion</i>;
the <i>Vitals</i>, for want of <i>Refrigeration</i> and <i>Refreshment</i>;
and the <i>Natural Spirits</i>, for want of sufficient <i>Respiration</i>
and <i>Nutrition</i>: <i>They</i> all concur to make a <i>Commotion</i>,
and (as it were) a victorious <i>Revolt</i> or an <i>Effort</i> pushing
for <i>CONQUEST</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>INFANT</i> being thus irritated, immediately
shakes off its <i>Fetters</i>, breaks the <i>Ligaments</i>, rents the
<i>Membranes</i>, thrusts through the <i>Enclosures</i>, and makes
its most vigorous <i>Attempts</i> to enlarge itself from the
<i>Prison</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, into that of the <span class='sc'>World</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> <i>Enlargement</i> depends very much indeed
upon <i><em class='gesperrt'>NATURE</em></i>, but more particularly on the
<i>Strength</i> and <i>Vigour</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>, seconded by a peculiar
<i>Faculty</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, that by degrees is drawn-in
to <i>Consent</i>, and <i>Endeavour</i> to dislodge and expel its
troublesome and obstreperous <i>GUEST</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> the <i>INFANT</i>, during the whole Time of
<i>Gestation</i>, adhering to the <i>WOMB</i>, by the <i>Umbilicals</i>,
as the <i>Fruit</i> does to the <span class='sc'>Tree</span> by the <i>Stalks</i>, upon this
Occasion distends the <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>, and having valiantly
turn’d itself, breaks the <i>Membranes</i>, and dissolves the <i>Acetabula</i>:
When also the <i>Orifice</i> of the <i>WOMB</i> is competently
open’d; and <i>That</i> (in <i>Avicenna</i>’s memorable
Words<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c017'><sup>[159]</sup></a>) at the Command of the great <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>God</em></span>. Upon
This the <i>Waters</i> flow; the <i>Umbilicals</i> parting from the
<i>WOMB</i> and their proper <i>Vessels</i>, and the <i>Veins</i> and <i>Arteries</i>
of the <i>SECUNDINE</i> severing themselves, in like
manner; As ripe <i>Fruit</i>, or the <i>Leaves</i> of <span class='sc'>Trees</span> in <i>Autumn</i>
fall-off naturally, or break from their proper <i>Stalks</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> the <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>, exerting its extensive and
expulsive <i>Faculties</i>, excludes the Legitimate <i>INFANT</i>:
To which great <i>Work</i> also, the <i>Painful Labours</i>, and
<i>Labouring Pangs</i> of the <i>MOTHER</i> (in the manner they
happen with the contracted <i>Spirits</i>, depress’d <i>Midriff</i>,
and compress’d <i>Muscles</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Abdomen</em></span>) contribute
not a little <i>Help</i>. And, in short, this stupendous <i>Work</i>
or <i>Action</i> is called <i>BIRTH</i>; and is nothing else, but an
<i>Exclusion</i> of the <i>mature CHILD</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> <i>BIRTH</i> proceeds either from <i>Causes</i> of
the <i>INFANT</i>, or from <i>Causes</i> of the <i>WOMB</i>: Of the
<i>INFANT</i>, because through the strict <i>Confinement</i> of a
narrow Place, and Defect<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c017'><sup>[160]</sup></a> of <i>Aliment</i>, and <i>Refrigeration</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>It kicks and spurns for its <span class='sc'>Exit</span>: Of the <i>WOMB</i>,
because about that <i>Time</i>, being overloaded and aggrieved
by the <i>Bulk</i> and <i>Weight</i> of the <span class='sc'>Child</span>, it endeavours,
by its own expulsive <i>Faculty</i>, to disburthen
itself, and propel or drive it forth to the utmost of its
Power. For——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> it is the proper <i>Function</i> of the <span class='sc'>Stomach</span>, to
eject the <i>noxious Humours</i> by Vomit, and deject the <i>Natural
Excrements</i> into the <i>INTESTINES</i>; as it is also
the <i>Office</i> of the <i>RECTUM</i> to evacuate the <i>Fæces</i>; as likewise
the <i>Profusion of the Urine</i> is the <i>Action</i> of the <span class='sc'>Bladder</span>;
as again the <i>Extrusion</i> of all <i>fuliginous Matters</i> is
the <i>Work</i> of the <span class='sc'>Heart</span> and <span class='sc'>Lungs</span>; and as, at last, the
<i>Effusion</i> of the <i>Genital</i> <span class='sc'>Seed</span> (in <i>Venery</i>) is the <i>Operation</i>
of the <i>Virile</i> <span class='sc'>Testicles</span>: So the <i>Exclusion</i> of the <i>Mature
FOETUS</i> is the <i>Eighth</i><a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c017'><sup>[161]</sup></a> and last proper <i>Action</i> of the
<i>WOMB</i>; which is justly deem’d the only <i>Primary Agent</i>
and <i>Active Cause</i> of <i>BIRTH</i>, as the excluded <i>FOETUS</i>
is the <i>Passive</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> this <i>BIRTH</i> is not always <i>Uniform</i>; for as it
differs in <i>Time</i>, so it does also in <i>Manner</i>: From hence
we have with respect to the <span class='sc'>Time</span>, <i>Legitimate</i> and <i>Illegitimate
BIRTHS</i>, which being already discuss’d<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c017'><sup>[162]</sup></a>, I shall
resume nothing by way of <i>Repetition</i> in this Place: And
with respect to the <span class='sc'>Manner</span>, we have also two general
<span class='sc'>Sorts</span>, namely, <i>Natural</i> and <i>Preternatural BIRTHS</i>;
which together with their particular <i>Branches</i>, I am
now to enter upon, without any farther Digression.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> II.</span><br /> <i>Of Natural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>BY</em> a <i>Natural BIRTH</i>, I mean nothing else, but
that which is perform’d without any <i><em class='gesperrt'>ART</em></i> or
<i>Artificial Means</i>; which <i>BIRTH</i> (of itself) strictly observes
the Order and Appointment of <i>Nature</i>: That
is, in the <i>INFANT</i>’s coming <i>Head foremost</i>, <i>Face downwards</i>,
<i>Arms following</i>, extended (along the <i>Sides</i>) strait
<i>upwards</i>, towards the <i>Thighs</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><i><em class='gesperrt'>HIPPOCRATES</em></i>’s <i>Reason</i><a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c017'><sup>[163]</sup></a>, in short, for the
<i>CHILD</i>’s thus turning and presenting itself, is very
good; <i>viz.</i> Because of all the <i>Parts</i>, the <span class='sc'>Head</span> is the
Heaviest about the Time of <i>BIRTH</i>, as appears more
at large from <i>Sect.</i> I. <i>Chap.</i> 10.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> besides this Argument, I believe Wise <i>Nature</i>
has also order’d it <i>thus</i>; because <i>This</i> indubitably
is the most <i>safe</i> and <i>easy Manner</i> of <i>EXITION</i> both for
the <i>Mother</i> and <i>Infant</i>: Insomuch that by all other
<i>Methods</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>EXTRACTION</em></i>, <i>One</i> or the <i>Other</i>, and
sometimes <i>Both Lives</i> are, or may be, endanger’d, if
not very dextrously perform’d, according to the best
Laws of Art and Judgment, as by and by will more
manifestly appear.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> because I have generally observ’d most <i>Authors</i>
to treat promiscuously of <i>BIRTHS</i>, not only accounting
some, which are really <i>Natural</i>, to be <i>Preternatural</i>;
but also both handling and writing of them as
<i>such</i>, only because attended with some difficult Circumstances:
I shall (in this place) take Leave to make an
agreeable <i>Distinction</i> betwixt the <i>different Sorts</i> of <i>Natural
BIRTHS</i>, in order to make every thing the more
clear and obvious to the <i>Conception</i> of the <span class='sc'>Reader</span>. Upon
which Account therefore, I shall reduce <i>These</i> to <i>two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Heads</i>, and that under the <span class='sc'>Titles</span> of <i>Natural Easy</i>, and
<i>Natural Difficult BIRTHS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>FIRST</i> of which I include in this <i>Chapter</i>;
but because in this <i>Case</i> (which I call a <i>Natural Easy
<em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>), <i>Nature</i> alone always performs the <i>Work</i>,
without any Help of <i>ART</i> or <i>Artful Means</i>; and because
also the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> (upon this Occasion) has but little or
nothing to do, save only to observe the concluding <i>Chapters</i>
of the last preceding <span class='sc'>Section</span>; and upon receiving
the <span class='sc'>Child</span>, immediately to manage and provide both for
the <span class='sc'>Mother</span> and the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> according to their several
<i>Necessities</i>, as hereafter shall be inculcated in the respective
<i>Chapters</i> of the next following <span class='sc'>Section</span>: I say, for these
<i>Reasons</i>, I have no Room here to insist farther on this
present <span class='sc'>Head</span>; wherefore I proceed in course to the
<i>SECOND Sort</i> of these <i>BIRTHS</i>. Namely——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> III.</span><br /> <i>Of Natural Difficult <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THO</em>’ indeed every <i>difficult Expulsion</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>,
from whatsoever <i>Cause</i> it may proceed,
is verily a <i>Difficult BIRTH</i>; yet I shall here distinguish
a <i>difficult One</i> from a <i>preternatural BIRTH</i>; not only
that I may thereby, the better avoid the <i>Confusion</i>
which others have led themselves into, by treating of
<span class='sc'>Both</span> promiscuously, but also that my <i>Method</i> may
tend the more to the peculiar Benefit and Advantage
of the Ingenious <span class='sc'>Reader</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> I call that a <i>Difficult BIRTH</i>;
where, notwithstanding the <i>Figure</i> and <i>Dimensions</i> of
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i>, answer in all respects to its proper <i>natural
Posture</i>, in a <i>Perpendicular</i> <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, duly situated, yet
the <i>Exclusion</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>, is retarded, by some
certain <i>Opposition</i> or <i>Difficulty</i>. From hence proceeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the real <i>Difference</i> between <i>This</i> and the <i>Natural Easy
BIRTH</i>, forasmuch as <i>This</i> always requires <i>less</i> or <i>more</i>
skilful <i>Assistance</i>, according to various Circumstances,
and <i>That</i> but <i>Little</i> or <i>none at all</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> the <i>Causes</i> of <i>Difficult BIRTHS</i> are very
various, and according to the <i>Nature</i> of them, <i>This</i>
sometimes proves equally as dangerous as the <i>Preternatural</i>;
but when so it happens, I have commonly observed
the <i>Fault</i> to be, for the most Part wholly owing
to the arrogant <i><em class='gesperrt'>MIDWIFE</em></i>, who either knew not
how to remove the <i>Cause</i> and facilitate the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em>
herself</i>, or delay’d applying betimes to some <i>Abler Person</i>,
for the <i>Relief</i> and <i>Safety</i> of her Labouring <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMAN</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> arises a Fundamental <span class='sc'>Maxim</span>, which I
would lay down for a memorable <i>Rule</i> to all such <span class='sc'>Ignorants</span>;
that no <i>MIDWIFE</i> ought to keep a <span class='sc'>Woman</span>
in this Condition under her <i>Hands</i> (especially in a <i>Place</i>
where extraordinary <i>Help</i> is to be had) any <i>longer</i>,
than she finds the <i>Advances</i> of <i>BIRTH</i> answer to the
Proportion of <i>Time</i> spent about it: But forthwith she
ought to deliver her up to the <i>Care</i> of the more Skilful
and Judicious <i>Practiser</i> in this <span class='sc'>Art</span>. In which <i>Case</i>,
of <i>Compliance</i> and <i>Condescension</i>, she is to be highly commended
for her tender <i>Care</i>, and cautious <i>Concern</i>;
whereas upon acting contrary to this good <i>Rule</i> out of
Pride or Obstinacy, and the <i>fatal Accident</i> ensuing, I
have known the <i>MIDWIFE</i> to have been try’d for her
<i>Life</i> in the City of <i>Venice</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> that I may render every thing <i>Plain</i> and <i>Easy</i>
to the <i>Apprehension</i> of the weakest <span class='sc'>Reader</span>, by reason
that the <i>Causes</i> of <i>Difficult BIRTHS</i> are both <i>different</i>
and <i>numerous</i>, I shall again reduce them to <i>Two</i> <span class='sc'>Classes</span>;
namely, <i>External</i> and <i>Internal</i>: The <i>External</i>, I shall
include in the next following <i>Chapter</i>; but the <i>Internal
Causes</i>, requiring a more Curious and Extensive <i>Dilucidation</i>,
may (I hope) be pertinently divided into a
<i>Three-fold Difference</i>; viz. <i>Causes</i> of the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span><span class='sc'>Infant</span>, and of the <span class='sc'>Passages</span>; which I propose to
handle particularly, all in their due <i>Order</i>. But <i>First</i>,</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>
<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_233.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> IV.</span><br /> <i>Of Difficult <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>, proceeding from External Causes.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> all <i>difficult Cases</i>, the <span class='sc'>Cure</span> or <i>Remedy</i> chiefly depends
upon the certain <i>Knowledge</i> of the <i>Nature of
the Case</i>, and the <i>Cause</i> of the <i>Difficulty</i>: Since (according
to <i>Celsus</i><a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c017'><sup>[164]</sup></a>, that noble <i>Roman Physician</i>) it is not to
be suppos’d that <i>He</i> should know how to <i>remedy Diseases</i>,
who knows not their <i>Original Causes</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> as in other <i>Cases</i>, so also in <i>MIDWIFERY</i>, the
<i>Cause</i> being known, the <i>Difficulty</i> is easily remov’d; but
especially when it only proceeds from <i>External Causes</i>,
it requires no great <span class='sc'>Art</span>, save only the <i>MIDWIFE</i>’S
particular <i>Notice</i> and discreet <i>Animadversion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em>, <i>FIRST</i>, for Instance, in <i>Case</i> of any <i>Difficulty</i>,
occasion’d by an <i>Intemperature</i>, or inclement <i>Constitution</i>
of <span class='sc'>Weather</span> and <span class='sc'>Air</span>; the more adverse or inclement
the <span class='sc'>Weather</span> is, the more tender <i>Care</i> ought to be
taken of the <i>Labouring Woman</i>: Namely, in <span class='sc'>Summer</span>,
when the <i>Heat</i> scorches so much as to dissipate the <i>Woman’s
Strength</i>, she ought to <span class='sc'>Labour</span> in a <i>Ground-Chamber</i>
backwards, which may be strewed (for the
Purpose) with <i>Vine</i> or <i>Willow-Leaves</i>, <i>Rose-Water</i>, and
a little <i>Vinegar</i>; as it is customary in <i>hot Countries</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> <span class='sc'>Winter</span>, when the <i>Cold</i> pinches so as to condense
and astringe the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and the <i>Passages</i>, she ought to
<span class='sc'>Labour</span> in an <i>Upper-Room</i>, kept moderately warm with
one continued <i>Fire</i>; the <i>MIDWIFE</i> rubbing gently the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span><i>Hypogastrick</i> and <i>Ischiatick Regions</i> every now and then
with hot <i>Cloathes</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> <span class='sc'>Spring</span> and <span class='sc'>Fall</span>, when parching dry <i>Weather</i>,
with <i>North</i> and <i>East Winds</i> most abound, the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MIDWIFE</em></i>
ought not only to rub these <i>Inferiour Regions</i>
with hot <i>Cloaths</i>; but also to qualify the <i>Influences</i>
of the <i>Siccid AIR</i>, by anointing the <i>Passages</i> with proper
<i>Unguents</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>A <span class='sc'>Second</span> <i>External Cause</i> may proceed from the
<i>Passions</i> of the Will or Mind, as it often does from
<i>Fear</i> and <i>Despair</i>, <i>Dejection</i> and <i>Pusillanimity</i>: In which
<i>Case</i>, it is the <i>MIDWIFE</i>’s Duty to encourage her
<span class='sc'>Woman</span> by the Hopes of a <i>Speedy DELIVERY</i>, and
doing well under <span class='sc'>God</span>’s Blessing. When the Cause arises
from <i>Anger</i> or <i>Sorrow</i>, these are to be assuaged by the repeated
<i>Christian Exhortations</i>, and <i>Friendly Admonitions</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> and <span class='sc'>Gossips</span>. When it comes from <i>Pride</i>
and <i>Obstinacy</i>, as has been the <i>Case</i> of some <i>Lofty
Women</i>; who (deeming themselves too good, to be
treated after the <i>common Course</i> of Mankind) have refused
to undergo or permit the proper <i>Means</i>, absolutely
necessary for their own <i>Relief</i>; <span class='sc'>This</span> ought to be
severely check’d by the <i>Company</i>, especially by the <i>nearest
Friends</i>; the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> (by proper <i>Remonstrances</i>) convincing
her to her Shame of her obstinate <span class='sc'>Sin</span>. When
it proceeds, in fine, from <i>Bashfulness</i> or too strict a
<i>Modesty</i>, she may be justly reprehended of <i>Folly</i>; for
no Woman of good <span class='sc'>Sense</span> (how <i>Modest</i> and <i>Virtuous</i>
soever) will expose her own <i>Life</i> or her <span class='sc'>Infant</span>’s to
<i>Danger</i>, for the trifling <i>Fancies</i> or <i>Caprices</i> of her own
vain Imagination, especially in a <i>Case</i> where <i>like things
happen to All</i> equally of Flesh and Blood.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> when it happens to proceed from the <i>Woman</i>’s
being ill-affected, or owing a private <i>Grudge</i> or
<i>Hatred</i> to any in the <i>Company</i>, (as I once knew it to be
the <i>Cause</i> of a difficult and lingring <i>BIRTH</i>) <i>She</i> ought
to speak her Mind freely, at least to her <i>MIDWIFE</i>;
who ought to give the <i>Person</i> civil Notice to retire
forthwith, for certain Reasons, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>A <span class='sc'>Third</span> <i>External Cause</i> of a <i>difficult <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i> may
proceed from a <i>wrong Position</i>, or other <i>sinistrous Methods</i>
taken to assist the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>: In which <i>Case</i>, such <i>Inconveniencies</i>
are to be alter’d, and better <i>Measures</i> practis’d;
for <i>thus</i> the <i>Cause</i> being removed, the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>
differs in Nothing from <i>That</i> of the <i>Natural Easy Case</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHENCE</em> I come, in the next Place, to speak
of <i>Difficult BIRTHS</i>, proceeding from <i>Internal Causes</i>;
and because they are <i>Three-fold</i>, as has been before observed,
I shall assign them as many respective <i>Chapters</i>,
treating of <i>Each</i> in their due Order, as mentioned.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> <i>this</i> (as in the <i>former Case</i>) the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> must
use her most acute and nicest <i>Judgment</i>, to find out
the particular <i>Cause</i> of the <i>Difficulty</i>. Which being
done,</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> <i>She</i> finds it arises from the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>’s being
too <i>Young</i>, or too <i>Old</i>, of her <i>first Child</i>, or too <i>Lean</i> at

which ought to be done some time <i>before</i>, as well as in

bear down her <i>PAINS</i>; or if she be over <i>tender</i>, <i>sensible</i>,
and <i>apprehensive</i> of <i>PAIN</i>; or too <i>weak</i>, and not <i>able</i> to
contribute or assist by her own forcing <i>Endeavours</i>; or
<i>short-winded</i>, and not capable to constrain her <i>Spirits</i>
downwards: In all these <i>Cases</i> she is to be kept <i>upright</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>for the more free <i>Respiration</i>, as well as for encreasing her
<i>PAINS</i>, <i>standing</i> or <i>walking</i> about the Room, according to
her <i>Strength</i>, being supported under her <i>Arms</i>, and not
put to <span class='sc'>Bed</span> until at least the <i>WATERS</i> are broke. But,
in the mean Time, the <i>weak</i> and <i>tender</i> <span class='sc'>Woman</span> ought
to be now and then comforted and refreshed with <i>fresh
soft Eggs</i>, good <i>Broths</i>, <i>Jellies</i>, a little <i>Wine</i> and <i>Toast</i>,
a little <i>Wine</i> and <i>Water</i>, or such like convenient <i>Things</i>,
as well as with the <i>Hopes</i> of a <i>speedy</i> <span class='sc'>Delivery</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>WHEN</em> the <i>PAINS</i> are not <i>Natural</i> or <i>Genuine</i>;
but <i>Spurious</i>, <i>Faint</i> and <i>Languid</i>; or <i>Shifting</i> and
<i>Tergiversant</i>; such are to be assuaged by proper <i>Lenitives</i>
and <i>Anodynes</i>; which being regularly done, the
<i>Genuine Pains</i> may be excited by proper <i>Clysters</i>, and divers
other Means. But I would advise none to a
<i>Profuse Use</i> of <i>MEDICINES</i> in such <i>Cases</i>, since I well
know that many a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span> has lost her <i>Life</i> by
using <i>dolorifick Medicines</i>, prescribed by imprudent
<i>MIDWIVES</i>, without considering, or so much as
knowing the true Circumstances of the <i>Condition</i>:
Whereas in most <i>Cases</i>, by the ingenious <i>Motion</i> of an
<i>Experienc’d Hand</i> only, the <span class='sc'>Pains</span> may be sufficiently awaken’d,
and the <span class='sc'>Birth</span> safely promoted.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>WHEN</em> the <i>Difficulty</i> proceeds from the <i>Debility</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, or its <i>Expulsive Faculty</i>, not being
able or capable to <i>Exclude</i> the <i>INFANT</i>, because of a
more strong and valid <i>Retentive Power</i>: In this <i>Condition</i>,
if there be no evident <i>External Cause</i> to be obviated,
it depends chiefly upon the <i>Subtile Hand</i> of the
<i>MIDWIFE</i>, to assist the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> in its <i>Function</i>; and
otherways the <i>PATIENT</i> is only to be treated as in
the <i>Case</i> of the <i>weak</i> and <i>tender</i> <span class='sc'>Woman</span> above-mentioned.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>WHEN</em> the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> is taken with any <i>Acute Disease</i>,
the <i>BIRTH</i> is to be prompted by all safe <i>Means</i>; and
if a <i>Natural DELIVERY</i> does not presently succeed, an
<i>Artificial</i> one must (without Loss of <i>Time</i>) be undertaken.
As in the <i>Case</i> of immoderate and continual
<i>Floodings</i>, with concomitant <i>Convulsions</i>, which always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>proceed from the Separation of the <i>SECUNDINE</i> (either
in whole or in part) from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and happen
many different ways, as already mentioned at large<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c017'><sup>[165]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> these <i>Cases</i>, especially if the <span class='sc'>Secundine</span> is found (by
the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>) at the <i>Orifice</i>, there is no Hope of <i>Stopping</i>
them by any other <i>Means</i>, than by <i>delivering</i> the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>;
which now the <i>sooner</i> done, the <i>better</i> (for saving
two <i>Lives</i>) and <i>that</i> whether at full time of <i>Reckoning</i>
or not. But this <i>Operation</i>, I conceive, is to be most discreetly
<i>Undertaken</i> in the manner following, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Woman</i> is to be placed in <span class='sc'>Bed</span>, with the <i>Upper</i>
and <i>Lower</i> Part of her Body almost <i>equal</i>, then the
<span class='sc'>Midwife</span> is gently and gradually to introduce her
<i>Fingers</i> into the <i>Orifice</i>, dilating it cautiously with <i>one</i> or
<i>two</i>, until she can enter them <i>All</i>; when opening the
<span class='sc'>Matrix</span> by Degrees, she gets in her <i>Whole Hand</i>, and
thereby <i>first</i> carefully tears the <i>Membrane</i> with her <i>Nails</i>,
if the <i>WATERS</i> are not previously broke: Then she
puts her <i>Hand</i> in the same <i>Membrane</i> to the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>’s
<i>Feet</i>, seeking them in their <i>Place</i>, where they are to be
found, when they don’t present themselves at <i>First</i>:
Because, the <i>Hold</i> by the <i>FEET</i> being <i>Better</i>, it is more
easy to <i>deliver</i> by <i>Them</i>, in this Case, than by the <i>HEAD</i>,
or any <i>other Part</i>. After <i>this</i> the <i>FEET</i> being found,
the <span class='sc'>Child</span> is easily <i>turn’d</i>, as long as the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is loose
and slippery, and the <i>Humours</i> not quite flown off; which
being nicely done, the <i>FEET</i> are to be drawn out
<i>both together</i>, if possible; but if otherways, <i>they</i> must be
drawn down <i>separately</i>, with <i>great</i> Caution: And so
being conjoin’d or held fast together, they are to be
drawn forward with <i>one Hand</i>, whilst the <i>other</i> is circumspectly
thrust towards the <i>Knees</i> or <i>Buttocks</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Child</span>, in order thereby to turn also the whole
Body of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>, so that its <i>Face</i>, <i>Belly</i>, and <i>Toes</i>
may tend downwards towards the <i>RECTUM</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this <i>Posture</i> the <span class='sc'>Child</span> may be gently and gradually
extracted with Ease; next the <i>SECUNDINE</i> must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>fetch’d away in its Turn, and lastly the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is to be
thoroughly cleans’d of all <i>heterogeneous</i> Bodies, as formerly
directed<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c017'><sup>[166]</sup></a>. And thus the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> (having yielded up its
<i>Contents</i>) immediately contracts, by which <i>MEANS</i> of
divine Appointment, the Vessels close and shut firmly,
and consequently the <i>FLUX</i> ceases, together with all
the concomitant <i>SYMPTOMS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> it is to be well remembred, that this <i>Operation</i>
ought to be <i>timely</i> perform’d; that is, before the
<span class='sc'>Woman</span> has lost too much <i>Blood</i>, or is too much spent;
in which <i>Condition</i> such a painful Attempt would but
accelerate her <i>Death</i>. As to her <i>Regimen</i> next, upon
this melancholy Occasion, <i>She</i> must be duly provided
for <i>beforehand</i>, that she may be able to undergo and
stand out such an extream difficult <i>DELIVERY</i>; and
afterwards, that she may recruit her <i>Spirits</i>, and retrieve
her exhausted <i>Strength</i>: For which Purposes, she
ought to be supplied from time to time with some
good <i>Broths</i>, <i>Jellys</i>, and a little generous <i>Wine</i>, smelling
continually <i>Rose-Vinegar</i>, and applying repeated warm
<i>Toasts</i> dipt in <i>Wine</i> (in which <i>Cinnamon</i> has been infus’d
or boil’d) to the <i>Region</i> of her <span class='sc'>Heart</span>, as also <i>Napkins</i>
dipt in a Mixture of <i>Water</i> and <i>Vinegar</i> about her
<span class='sc'>Reins</span>, in order for turning the <i>Course</i> of the <span class='sc'>Flux</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> Things being all duly and artfully perform’d,
the <span class='sc'>Patient</span> (under God) will soon <i>recover</i>
and be <i>in Statu quo</i>. Now <i>These</i>, in short, are all the
<i>principal</i> and most common <i>Causes</i> of <i>difficult</i> <span class='sc'>Births</span>
proceeding from the part of the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>; which being
thus discussed with all Brevity, I go on to——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VI.</span><br /> <i>Of Difficult <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em> proceeding from Causes of the <em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> sometimes also happens, that the <i>Difficulty</i> in
<span class='sc'>Labour</span> arises from the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>: And <i>that
<em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em></i> when <i>Two</i> or <i>More</i> strive for <i>Priority</i> in
<i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> this <i>Condition</i> the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> can no otherways
distinguish or discover, but by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>; and
when the <i>one</i> is more <i>forward</i> than the <i>other</i>, ’tis not to
be done or known, until she has even <i>touch’d</i> the very
<i>Fund</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>: Because sometimes it so happens,
that <i>One</i> <span class='sc'>Child</span> has its <i>Hands</i> and <i>Feet</i> so intermix’d,
that whatever way <i>She</i> turns her <i>Hand</i>, she finds <i>Legs</i>
or <i>Arms</i>, <i>Hands</i> or <i>Feet</i>, which often deceives <span class='sc'>Midwives</span>,
believing there are <i>TWINS</i>. But in this perplex’d
<i>Case</i> the most sure and only certain <i>Sign</i>, is, when she
feels <i>two Heads</i> or <i>two Backs</i>; for then she cannot be Mistaken,
since <i>one Body</i> cannot have <i>two Heads</i>, unless it
be a <span class='sc'>Monster</span>, which may be soon discover’d by feeling
if the <i>double Head</i> be fix’d to <i>one</i> and the <i>same Body</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in the <i>Case</i> of <i>TWINS</i> or <i>more Children</i> (as long
as they come right) the <span class='sc'>Delivery</span> is perform’d, as if
the <i>Woman</i> had but <span class='sc'>One</span>, in the <i>Natural Case</i> already
Stated; so that I shall repeat or recapitulate Nothing
of what I have said, only that the <span class='sc'>After-Birth</span>, or
<span class='sc'>Births</span> are not to be <i>touch’d</i>, until all the <i>CHILDREN</i>
are Born: Upon which drawing gently the <i>Navel
Strings</i> (in their Turns) with the <i>One Hand</i>, the <i>Other</i>
brings them forth easily and orderly; as is set forth
more fully in <span class='sc'>Sect.</span> IV. <i>Chap.</i> 18.</p>

<p class='c005'>A SECOND <i>difficult LABOUR</i> may proceed from the
<i>Weakness</i> and <i>Debility</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, or from its being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>too <i>Small-grown</i>; in which <i>Case</i>, both the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> and
the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> are to use their best mutual <i>Endeavours</i>
to promote the <i>BIRTH</i>, since the <i>CHILD</i> can do little
or nothing for itself, and the <i>Less</i> it is, the less it is
affected with the <i>THROWS</i> of the <i>Mother</i>, and the
less <i>Impression</i> her Impulses make upon it: Whereupon
<i>Nature</i> is to be assisted in this weak <i>Condition</i> by
all convenient <i>Means</i>, whereof <i>THAT</i> of the <i>Agile</i> or
<i>Nimble Hand</i> is the most effectual.</p>

<p class='c005'>A THIRD <i>difficult BIRTH</i> may proceed from the
<span class='sc'>Infant</span>’s being too <i>Big</i>; In which Place I must
previously apprize the <i>READER</i>, that I no ways mean
a <i>MONSTER</i> or <i>Hydropical CHILD</i>, but only <i>One full</i>,
<i>well</i>, or <i>Big-grown</i>, which is only reckoned too <i>Big</i> in
regard of the <i>Maternal Passages</i>, which may be too
<i>Small</i> in Proportion.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this <i>Case</i>, there is an absolute Necessity for <i>Manual
Assistance</i>, since the <span class='fss'>PAINS</span> (however penetrating
or forcible) cannot effect the <i>Work</i>. But and if the
<i>INFANT</i> is fallen down (well turn’d) into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>,
the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> using her best and most skilful Endeavours
to <i>dilate</i> the <i>Passages</i> below near the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>, the
<span class='sc'>Child</span> may be easily brought forth (without any dangerous
<i>Instrument</i>) by her dextrous <i>Hand</i> only accomplishing
the <i>Work</i>. In the mean Time, however, it is
to be minded always, that <i>This</i> is still more safely and
commodiously done by the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>, than by the <span class='sc'>Head</span>,
after carefully dilating the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>, taking this
Opportunity in the beginning of the <span class='sc'>Labour</span>, before
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em></i> is too much press’d down into the
<span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> <i>these</i> are, in fine, the most common <i>Causes</i>
on the Part of the <i>INFANT</i>, whence I come to touch
upon <i>difficult BIRTHS</i>, proceeding from <i>Causes</i> of the
<i>Passages</i>; which, because they are various, I subdivide
into a <i>Fivefold Diversity</i>; viz. <i>Difficult <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em></i>, proceeding
from <i>Causes</i> of the <span class='sc'>Membranes</span>, from <i>Causes</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, from <i>Causes</i> of the <span class='sc'>Bones</span> of the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>,
from <i>Causes</i> of the <span class='sc'>Bladder</span> and <span class='sc'>Rectum</span>, and from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span><i>Causes</i> of the <span class='sc'>Vagina</span>: And because all these require
to be singularly explain’d, and particularly insisted upon,
I shall assign them as many respective <i>Chapters</i>.
And <i>First</i>——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VII.</span><br /> <i>Of Difficult <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>, proceeding from Causes of the <em class='gesperrt'>MEMBRANES</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>SUCH</em> <i>Difficulties</i> as These, in <i>BIRTH</i>, may arise,
<i><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em></i> from the <i>Strength</i> and <i>Firmness</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Membranes</span>; when they happen to be so <i>gross</i>, <i>callous</i>,
or <i>thick</i>, that the <i>INFANT</i> cannot easily break through
them.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this <i>Case</i>, when the <i>MIDWIFE</i> finds the <i>Orifice</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> sufficiently dilated, for the <i>Circumference</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, and the <span class='sc'>Child</span> so forward in the <i>Passage</i>,
that it is ready for <i>BIRTH</i>, and only impeded by the
rigid or stiff <span class='sc'>Membrane</span>; then <i>she</i> has just Authority
to break it gently with her <i>Nails</i> and <i>Fingers</i>; taking
Care in the <span class='sc'>Act</span> not to draw the <span class='sc'>Membrane</span> towards
<i>her</i>, because thereby the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Secundine</em></span> (of which the
<span class='sc'>Membrane</span>, tho’ distinguish’d from the <span class='sc'>Placenta</span>, is
in Effect, but the <i>Thinner Part</i>) would be untimely
separated from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and the <i>INFANT undone</i>,
unless presently <i>Born</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> the <i>MIDWIFE</i>, after All, must always remember,
not to attempt <i>This</i>, before these mentioned
<i>Signs</i> are obvious to her <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Touch</em></span>; otherways the
<span class='sc'>Waters</span> being too soon discharged, the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i> is
left behind, the <i>Passages</i> grow dry, and <i>that</i> which
might have been an <i>Easy</i> and <i>Speedy</i>, proves a <i>Difficult</i>
and <i>Lingring BIRTH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> the self-same <i>Consequences</i> arise from the <i>Weakness</i>
and <i>Tenuity</i> of the <i>MEMBRANES</i>; when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>are so <i>thin</i> and <i>soft</i>, that they break, and the <span class='sc'>Waters</span>
(which are destin’d to lubricate and moisten the <i>Passages</i>)
flow before their Time: In both which <i>Cases</i>,
the <i>Office</i> of the <span class='sc'>Waters</span> must be supply’d by proper
<i>Fomentations</i>, and <i>Oils</i>, which (however costly) falls far
short of the <i>Effect</i> of what is so <i>Natural</i>. However,
in short, neither of these <i>Conditions</i>, under the diligent
<i>Hand</i> of the expert <span class='sc'>Midwife</span>, can differ far from the
<i>Case</i> of an <i>Easy BIRTH</i>, as already defin’d; wherefore
I proceed regularly to——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VIII.</span><br /> <i>Of Difficult <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>, proceeding from the Causes of the <em class='gesperrt'>PELVIS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>DIFFICULT</em> <i>BIRTHS</i> on part of the <i>Passages</i>,
happen frequently, because of some perverse <i>Form</i>
of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PELVIS</em></i>, in these Respects; as by its being
either too <i>Large</i>, too <i>Narrow</i>, or too <i>Smooth</i>. But that
I may be the better understood in this Matter: <i>FIRST</i>,
by a <i>PELVIS</i> too <i>large</i>, I mean such an <i>One</i>, as is so in
comparison with the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> or <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>; in which
<i>Condition</i>, as the Womb can neither be firmly <i>fix’d</i>,
compactly <i>inclos’d</i>, or duly supported, so neither can
the <span class='sc'>Head</span> of the <i>Infant</i> and the <i>WATERS</i> be exactly depressed
upon the <i>Orifice</i>: Hence it often happens, that
(besides the <span class='sc'>Midwife’s</span> careful <i>Hand</i>) the <i>Privities</i> are
the best, if not the only <i>Defence</i>, against both the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> and the <span class='sc'>Child’s</span> falling out of the Body.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, By a <i>PELVIS</i> too <i>small</i>, I mean,
<i>such</i> an <i>One</i> as is so, in Consideration of the <span class='sc'>Size</span> of the
whole Body; in which <i>Condition</i>, the <i>INFANT</i> commonly
answering to that <i>Proportion</i>, its <i>Head</i> can by no
Possibility pass thro’ the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PELVIS</em></i>, in a <span class='sc'>Womb</span> well
seated, without great <i>Force</i>, by which Means the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> may be easily turn’d <i>obliquely</i>: And thus consequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>the <i>Smallness</i> of the <i>PELVIS</i>, may sometimes
prove the <i>Cause</i> of a <i>Preternatural</i>, as well as of a <i>Difficult
BIRTH</i>; and not only so, but also the <i>Death</i> of
both the <i>MOTHER</i> and <i>CHILD</i> may ensue thereupon,
unless timely deliver’d by an <i>Artful Hand</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIRDLY</em>, By a <i>PELVIS</i> too <i>smooth</i>, I mean
such an <i>One</i>, whose <i>Distance</i> betwixt the <i>OSSA PUBIS</i>
and the prominent Part of the <i>OS SACRUM</i> is too <i>narrow</i>;
in which <i>Condition</i>, tho’ the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> be well placed,
it cannot admit the <i>Head</i> (especially if large and well-grown)
without great <i>Difficulty</i>: And this <i>smooth PELVIS</i>
may also very easily turn the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> (either way)
<i>obliquely</i>, and consequently prove of the same dangerous
consequential <i>Effect</i> with the preceeding <i>Case</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> (I think) it evidently appears, how necessary
it is that all <i>MIDWIVES</i> should not only know
the <i>Form</i> and <i>Size</i> of the <i>PELVIS</i>, but also the <i>Situation</i>
and <i>Connexion</i> of its <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Bones</em></span>, as already describ’d
at large<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c017'><sup>[167]</sup></a>, that <i>she</i> may thereby the better distinguish
the <i>Circumstances</i> by plainly discerning the <i>Causes</i>, and
judge accurately of the <i>Position</i> of both the <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>
and the <i>INFANT</i>; so that in the beginning of the
<span class='sc'>Labour</span>, she may immediately discover how the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>
and its <i>Entrance</i> is form’d, whether <i>Large</i> or <i>Narrow</i>,
<i>Smooth</i> or <i>Round</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> this Reason, the <i>first Thing</i> that the <i>MIDWIFE</i>
ought to do, when she comes to a <i>Woman</i> in
<span class='sc'>Labour</span>, is to try by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, how all is circumstantiated,
with respect to these Things; and <i>This</i> is to
be done before the <i>WOMB</i> and the <i>CHILD</i> are fallen
down into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, that she may contrive her <i>Work</i>
accordingly. Because sometimes the <i>Exclusion</i> of the
<i>INFANT</i>, is to be hoped for, from the <span class='sc'>Pains</span> only;
sometimes <i>Nature</i> is to be prudently assisted; sometimes
there is an absolute Necessity for <i>extracting</i> the
<span class='sc'>Child</span> (without loss of Time) by an <i>Artful Hand</i>, as
will hereafter more clearly appear; and sometimes again
the same Necessity obliges us to <i>protract</i> the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span><i>BIRTH</i>, than we may save <i>One</i> or <i>Both Lives</i>: As in
the <i>Case</i> of a <i>smooth</i> <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, the <span class='sc'>Os Pubis</span> and the <span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span>
of the <span class='sc'>Sacrum</span> being but little distant, the <span class='sc'>Child</span>’s
<i>Head</i> is stopped; when if the <span class='sc'>Mother</span> should labour
much, or endeavour to force an expeditious <i>BIRTH</i>,
its tender <i>Head</i> (of course) must suffer in proportion;
Or perhaps the <span class='sc'>Brain</span> may break, by so hard a <i>Pressure</i>
against the <i>Bones</i>; or, finally (which is worse) it may
be so closely squeez’d between the <i>Bones</i>, that both
the <i>MOTHER</i> and the <i>INFANT</i> may peradventure
die, before any <i>BIRTH</i> can possibly succeed or come
happily into the World.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in this critical <i>Condition</i>, the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> is to
<i>labour</i> gently, and bear her <i>PAINS</i> (how violent soever)
patiently; the <i>MIDWIFE</i> always directing the
<i>Head</i>, at the same time by her safe <i>Hand</i>, into the <i>larger
Space</i>; by which <i>Means</i> at last, it passes gradually
through that <i>narrow Passage</i> without the least <i>Danger</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> same also is the <i>Condition</i> when the <i>PELVIS</i>
is too <i>small</i> or <i>narrow</i>; for by the <i>Woman</i>’s labouring
gently and deliberately, the <i>Head</i> is depressed softly
into an <i>oblique Figure</i>, and passes easily by Degrees:
Whereas, on the other hand, if it is forced by <i>Violence</i>,
it becomes <i>flat</i> and <i>broad</i>, and consequently incapable
of <i>Passing</i>, if not also <i>dash’d to Pieces</i>, as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> we clearly see, how easily <i>Ignorance</i> in
this Point, may lead common <span class='sc'>Midwives</span> into the
grossest of <i>Mistakes</i>; For what is more ordinary with
them, even in all <i>Cases</i>, than to advise the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> to
<i>strong Labour</i>, and to force her to <i>violent Depressions</i>: Insomuch
that <span class='sc'>Some</span> have <i>Arrogance</i> enough to carry their
<span class='sc'>Bottles</span> or <span class='sc'>Powders</span> about them, of which they neither
know the <i>Quality</i> nor <i>Virtue</i>; taking them only as
they are told (by the confident <span class='sc'>Quacks</span> or <i>Mercenary
Hands</i> which vend them) that they may encrease and
promote the <span class='sc'>Pains</span> of Labour, and <i>This</i> without having
any regard to the <i>Form</i> of the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, or the <i>Position</i> of
either the <i>WOMB</i>, or the <i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> short, the mature <i>Consideration</i> of this very <span class='sc'>Case</span>,
was not the least <i>Motive</i> which induced me to the
<span class='sc'>Work</span> in Hand; since I cannot but heartily commiserate
so many fine delicate <span class='sc'>Women</span>, as are <i>thus</i> every
day miserably handled, tormented, and exhausted, by
the <i>preposterous Management</i> of such indiscreet and imprudent
<i>MIDWIVES</i>. I may well say <i>exhausted</i>, or
<i>worn-out</i>; <i>This</i> being too evident, from the vast Number
of most beautiful <i>Women</i>, who, by this ill-manag’d
<i>Condition</i>, (notwithstanding they have all along heretofore,
enjoy’d a good State of <i>Health</i>, together with
the <i>Affluence</i> of other Worldly <i>Blessings</i>) have been more
dejected and broken both in <i>Complexion</i> and <i>Constitution</i>,
after <i>one</i> or <i>two BIRTHS</i>, than some <i>others</i> (judiciously
and expertly <i>delivered</i>) have been after <i>Twenty</i>: Such
is the great <i>Difference</i> betwixt the unskilful <i>Hands</i> or
<i>Conduct</i> of common <span class='sc'>Midwives</span>, and those Dextrous
<span class='sc'>Touches</span> or ingenious <i>Operations</i> of the more judicious

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> IX.</span><br /> <i>Of Difficult BIRTHS, proceeding from Causes of the Bones of the <em class='gesperrt'>PELVIS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'>Reader</span> may easily conceive, by the way,
that <i>these</i> are neither to be made <i>bigger</i> or <i>lesser</i> by
<span class='sc'>Art</span>; notwithstanding which, by using them <i>Skilfully</i>,
and treating them <i>Judiciously</i>, many a <i>Difficult <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>
may not only be prevented, but also many a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Life</em></span>
saved, as will manifestly appear from what follows.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> the <i>Bones</i>, upon which the Success of the
<i>BIRTH</i> chiefly depends, are the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>, and the
Point of the <span class='sc'>Sacrum</span>; which sometimes bend too much
<i>inwards</i>, and thereby obstruct and render the <span class='sc'>Passage</span>
so <i>narrow</i>, that no <i>BIRTH</i> can possibly succeed. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>again, It sometimes happens, that the <i>INFANT</i> falling
down into the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PELVIS</em></i>, and presenting itself <i>Head foremost</i>,
is oppos’d and stopped there by the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>:
As it also sometimes falls out, that the <i>Shoulders</i>
stick fast against the <i>Edge</i> of these <span class='sc'>Bones</span>; or the <i>Buttocks</i>
falling down and offering themselves <i>first</i>, may be
so fastened or affixed to them, that they can never be
<i>extracted</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> Misfortunes may proceed from <i>Either</i> of
these two different <i>Causes</i>; viz. Either from the <i>Grossness</i>
or large <i>Size</i> of these <i>Parts</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, or from
the <i>Narrowness</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PELVIS</em></i>, occasion’d by an ill
<i>Position</i> of its <i>Bones</i>, particularly of the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>;
which <i>Bone</i> when the <i>Head</i> cannot make it yield or
move, neither can it then possibly reach the <i>Orifice</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, to dilate it sufficiently: And, in short, if
the <i>Head</i> cannot effect this <i>essential Point</i>, much less can
the <i>Buttocks</i>, or any other <i>Part</i> be supposed capable of
doing it.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in all the above-mentioned <i>Cases</i>, I am sensible,
that most <i><em class='gesperrt'>MIDWIVES</em></i> (not knowing better)
ascribe the whole <i>Difficulty</i> to the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
and the <span class='sc'>Vagina</span>; upon which they ignorantly fall atearing
and dilating both the <i>One</i> and the <i>Other</i>, (never
minding the <i>Point</i> of the <span class='sc'>Sacrum</span>); and finding <i>these
Orifices</i> but little <i>open’d</i>, notwithstanding the frequent
<i>Repetition</i> of very severe <i>PAINS</i>, they imagine that
their substantial <i>Hardness</i> or <i>Thickness</i> is the only <span class='sc'>Cause</span>:
So that therefore (without regarding any <i>adjacent Part</i>)
they go on violently dilacerating sometimes the <i>Mouth</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and sometimes <i>That</i> of the <i>PRIVITIES</i>,
(as I have found it by Experience) quite to the <span class='sc'>Rectum</span>.
For such is their <i>Stupidity</i> in this Condition of <span class='sc'>Life</span> (as
<i>Daventer</i> well observes) that whilst they <i>thus</i> tear and
rend the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> to <i>Pieces</i> in a manner, they allow her
to sit over and above with the <i>Point</i> of the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>,
upon her <i>Seat</i> or <i>Bed</i>; or in some other wrong
<i>Posture</i>, which so presses and confines the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>
at the same Time, that neither of <i>these</i> can move:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Not minding at all that the chief <i>Pressures</i> and <i>Impulses</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, must first bear upon the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>
in order to remove it, before it can effect the <i>Dilatation</i>
of the <i>Orifice</i> or <i>Mouth</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>. Thus they
spend the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span>’s <i>Strength</i> in vain, break her <i>Spirits</i>,
and ruin her <i>Constitution</i> thro’ Ignorance; whilst a
capable <i>Person</i>, administring seasonable and judicious
<i>Help</i>, according to the Circumstances of the <i>Case</i>,
refreshes <i>Nature</i>, renews <i>Strength</i>, gives <i>Courage</i>, and
fills the (otherways languishing and despairing) <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMAN</em></i>,
with <i>Hopes</i> and <i>Assurances</i> of a happy <i><em class='gesperrt'>DELIVERY</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> short, the True <i>Method</i> of <i>Delivering</i> and helping
the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> conveniently, in the different <i>Conditions</i>
contain’d in this <i>Chapter</i>, depends entirely upon <i>repelling</i>
or thrusting back the <i>Point</i> of the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>,
together with the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>. I say (therefore) the
whole <i>Point</i> of the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>, and that <i>Fleshy Part</i>
lying about it, is to be <i>thrust back</i> and <i>dilated</i>, so that
the <i>Passage</i> may be sufficiently opened for the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>
to pass through; which patent <i>Dilatation</i> is to be promoted
by <i>pressing</i> also <i>back</i> the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>. Now these
Things, in short, may be all done cautiously without
creating any intense <i>Pain</i>, or the least Damage; and
<i>thus</i> the obstructed <i>Passage</i> being clear’d and open’d, the
<span class='sc'>Birth</span> advances regularly of Course, and the <i>CHILD</i> is
born with the greatest <i>Ease</i>, in the Space of a few Minutes:
Whereas otherways (without the Use of these
<i>Means</i>) both its <i>Own</i> and the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>’s <i>Destiny</i> may be
precarious or uncertain after some <i>Days</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Labour</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> it is certain, that by assisting a <i>Woman</i> in
<span class='sc'>Labour</span> seasonably and skilfully, her <i>PAINS</i> are happily
excited and encreased; whereas, on the contrary,
by <i>imprudent Treatment</i> they unhappily cease and
vanish, to her great Prejudice. Moreover, daily <i>Experience</i>
teaches us, that the very <i>different</i> <span class='sc'>Touching</span> of
Things, occasions different <i>Sensations</i>; and from thence
it is, that the <i>dextrous MIDWIFE</i> knows by <i>one</i> way
of <span class='sc'>Touching</span>, how to promote the <i>PAINS</i> of <i>Labour</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>and by <i>another</i>, how to retard or put them off according
as the Necessity of the <i>Case</i> requires; which
hereafter will appear more at large.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> that we may more particularly satisfy such
<i>MIDWIVES</i>, of our <i>Method</i> of repressing these <span class='sc'>Bones</span>,
and <i>Delivering</i> the <i>WOMAN</i> in the abovesaid <i>Cases</i>; I
must add, that, after placing the <i>PATIENT</i> in the
most convenient <i>Posture</i> for a <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMAN</em></i> in <i>Labour</i>,
as before fully enjoin’d<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c017'><sup>[168]</sup></a>, I would direct <i>Her</i> to
be <i>supported</i> by two Women, and mov’d so far off
the <span class='sc'>Bed</span> or <span class='sc'>Couch</span>, that the <i>Point</i> of the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>
may be free to yield or give way <i>backwards</i>, without
any the least <i>Impediment</i>: Then I would pass my whole
<i>Hand</i> at once (being first well anointed or dipp’d in
<i>Oil</i>) into the <i>VAGINA</i>, and from thence (if the <i>Head</i>
will admit it) into the <i>WOMB</i>, as occasion should require:
where, upon opening my <i>Hand broad</i>, that it
may press equally every where, I turn the <i>PALM upwards</i>,
and the <i>BACK downwards</i> against the <i>RECTUM</i>,
and the <i>OS SACRUM</i>: Thus I extend my <i>Fingers</i> as
far as possible to the <i>Head</i>, thrusting it a little <i>backwards</i>,
rather than hinder my <i>Hand</i> from being firmly
placed against the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>: Upon my <i>Hand</i> being
thus properly placed, as soon as the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAIN</em></i> begins to
threaten (which I commonly perceive before the <i>WOMAN</i>)
I advise her, to make good Use of the approaching
<i>Pains</i>, in order to <i>Labour</i> mutually, and depress
with all her Power, promising her my most faithful <i>Assistance</i>:
By which Time, as soon as the <span class='sc'>Pains</span> have seiz’d
her, and she doing her <i>Part</i>, I press my <span class='sc'>Hand</span> <i>backwards</i>,
first <i>softly</i>, and by degrees more <i>strongly</i>, against
the <i>Point</i> of the <span class='sc'>Sacrum</span>, bringing it at the same time
gradually <i>downwards</i>, that I may thereby make Room
for the <i>Head</i> sliding the same way; so that the more
<i>severe</i> the <i>PAINS</i> are, the more I depress still, and the
<i>harder</i> I press down with <i>Effectual PAIN</i>, the more vigorously
and successfully the <i>WOMAN</i> is able to <i>Labour</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> I enlarge the <i>Passage</i> with great Moderation,
so that the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>’s <i>Head</i> succeeds or follows my
<i>Hand</i>, as I bring it by little and little <i>back</i> again; and
this adviseable <i>Method</i> I would reiterate as often as the
<i>Case</i> should require, always encouraging my <i>WOMAN</i>,
by the most obliging Words: Upon which <i>She</i> suffering
no <i>PAIN</i> in vain, finds immediate <i>Relief</i>, recovers
her <i>Strength</i>, recollects her <i>Spirits</i>, and by jointly <i>labouring</i>
her <i>Best</i> with all her Force and Might, at last
produces her <span class='sc'>Child</span> with Comfort and Satisfaction,
whilst I congratulate her upon the Success of being a
<i>joyful MOTHER</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> supposing by the way, that the <i>INFANT</i>
offers its <i>Buttocks</i> first, they being neither so <i>round</i> nor
<i>hard</i> as the <i>HEAD</i>, I would then intrude all my <i>Fingers</i>
into the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> more easily; some of which (or
sometimes <i>All</i>) I would pass into the <i>Orifice</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> under the <i>Buttocks</i> as before into the <i>VAGINA</i>.
Now my <i>HAND</i> being placed there, I intently observe
the <i>PAINS</i> as they come on; then inviting the
<i>Woman</i> to <i>Labour</i>, I gradually press <i>backwards</i> as hard
as I can conveniently, drawing my <i>HAND downwards</i> as
before: But if in attracting it so, the <i>HAND</i> should
slide too much out of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, (which however I
endeavour to prevent) while the <i>PAINS</i> are yet upon
her; then as soon as they are over, I pass it up again,
that I may be ready against their <i>Return</i>. And <i>this</i>
I would reiterate upon every <i>PAIN</i>, so that the <span class='sc'>Child</span>
(guided by my <i>HAND</i>) may slide down at every Turn,
until at last the <i>Passage</i> is so dilated, that it may advance
gradually with <i>ease</i> into the World.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BY</em> these judicious <i>Means</i>; forcing back the <i>OS
COCCYGIS</i> by the <i>Pressure</i> of the <i>HAND</i>, as the
<i>PAINS</i> come on, I may not only dilate the <i>Passage</i>,
and enlarge the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; but also upon
retracting the <i>HAND</i> by degrees, I can gradually attract
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i> out of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, through the
<i>Narrowness</i> of the <i>PELVIS</i>: And thus, by this curious
<span class='sc'>Art</span>, (which I take to be one of the chief <i>Points</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>belonging to <span class='sc'>Midwifery</span>) I do fairly <i>deliver</i> the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>,
who by no other <i>Means</i> whatsoever, could be
preserved, together with her <i>INFANT</i>, in all Probability.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, tho’ I have candidly laid down this
<i>Method</i>, (conformable to the Doctrine of the most excellent
and ingenious <i>Instructers</i>) yet I would not
advise every coarse <i>Clumsy HAND</i> to undertake it, nor
<i>such</i> as are not thoroughly acquainted with the <i>Parts</i> of
Generation: For this <i>Performance</i> requires <i>Judgment</i> and
<i>Prudence</i>, as well as <span class='sc'>Art</span> and <i>Experience</i>. But however
yet in <i>Case</i> of <i>Necessity</i>, where no <i>Extraordinary Person’s
Assistance</i> can be had, as it often happens in the <i>Country</i>,
the <i>Ordinary MIDWIFE</i> ought not to neglect her
<i>Duty</i>: nevertheless, before she offers to attempt this
piece of extraordinary <i>Skill</i>, she ought to be very certain
that these <i>BONES</i> are the great <i>Impediment</i> and
<i>Difficulty</i> of the Delivery.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>DIFFICULTY</em> in <i>BIRTH</i> may also proceed from
the <i>BLADDER</i>, as (in like manner) it may from
the <i>RECTUM</i> or <i>Strait Gut</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> the <i>BLADDER</i>, when affected with
<i>Tumours</i>, <i>Ulcers</i>, or <i>Glands</i>, obstructing the <i>Passages</i>;
which however is more frequently occasioned by <i>Stones</i>
lodged in the <i>BLADDER</i>, or in its <i>Neck</i>: In either
of which <i>Conditions</i>, the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span>, by dilating the
<i>Passage</i> with a subtile <i>HAND</i>, must repel the <i>OS
COCCYGIS</i> according to <span class='sc'>Art</span> (as taught in the preceeding
<i>Chapter</i>) that the <i>HEAD</i> in falling down, may the
less offend the <i>BLADDER</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> same <i>Difficulty</i> may arise from the
<i>RECTUM</i>, when it happens in the same <i>Manner</i>, to be
affected with such obdurated <i>Glands</i>, <i>Tumours</i>, &amp;c.
for the <i>Consequence</i> is the same in shutting up the
<i>Passages</i>: In which <i>Case</i> the <i>MIDWIFE</i> is to depress
gently such <i>Excrescences</i>, of what kind soever, with her
cautious <i>HAND</i>, and consequently to dilate the <i>Passages</i>
by degrees (how much soever obstructed) for receiving
the <i>Head</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>; always having a
respect to the <i>affected Parts</i>, and bearing no harder
upon them than Necessity requires.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em> sometimes it happens, that the only
<i>Difficulty</i> in <i>LABOUR</i> proceeds from <i>hardened Excrements</i>
in this <i>Gut</i>, which may as effectually stop or shut
up the <i>Passage</i>, as any thing else, until duly voided and
evacuated by <i>one</i> or <i>more</i> proper <i>CLYSTERS</i>, as Occasion
directs.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> sometimes it also happens, that such <i>Difficulties</i>
arise from the falling out of the <i>Fundament</i> by the
strong and violent <i>THROWS</i> that the <i>Woman</i> Suffers
in <span class='sc'>Labour</span>: In which <i>Condition</i>, if the <i>CHILD</i> is
very forward in the <i>Passage</i>, before it <i>happens</i>, it may
be prevented by dissuading or hindering the <span class='sc'>Woman</span>
from <i>Labouring</i> so vehemently; but if it happen’d before
that time, it must be left so until the <i>BIRTH</i> be
accomplished; after which time, it is to be put up
exactly, and reduced to its proper <i>Place</i>, in the same
manner as the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> might be (in Case of its <i>Prolapse</i>,
as mentioned in the following <i>Chapter</i>) after duly <i>fomenting</i>
and <i>bathing</i> it with proper <i>Applicatives</i>: advertising
always to use no <i>CLYSTERS</i>, in time of
<span class='sc'>Child-Bed</span>; because such Means would readily excite
it again to a slippery <i>Relapse</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>DIFFICULTY</em> likewise in <i>LABOUR</i> may also
arise from the <i>VAGINA</i>, or <i>Neck</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>;
this <i>Part</i> being no less liable to the Affection of <i>Tumours</i>,
<i>Glands</i>, <i>Ulcers</i>, &amp;c. than any <i>Other</i> before-mentioned:
In <i>Either</i> of which <i>Cases</i>, my above-mentioned
<i>Method</i> in the foregoing <i>Chapter</i>, shall suffice for
the <i>MIDWIFE</i>’s <i>Instruction</i>; as also in <i>Case</i> of an
<i>Inflation</i> or <i>Inflammation</i> of the <i>Pudendum</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> sometimes also this <i>Difficulty</i> happens from
the falling down of the <i>VAGINA</i>; which <i>Accident</i>
may as well precede as follow after the <span class='sc'>Birth</span>, and <i>that</i>
by the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> pressing <i>hard</i> into that of
the <i>Privities</i>: So that sometimes, when the <i>MEMBRANE</i>
is <i>broke</i>, the <i>Head</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>, as well
as the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, slides down so far, as to
hang out of the <i>Body</i>; whereby the stressed <i>Ligaments</i>
(being too much relaxed) give way to the falling down
not only of the <i>VAGINA</i>, but also of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> it
self.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this sad <i>Condition</i> the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> must keep her
<span class='sc'>Bed</span>, and her <i>Body</i> equally situated, that either the
fallen <i>VAGINA</i> or <i>WOMB</i>, may recover and be immediately
restored to its <i>proper Place</i>; which being
done, other Matters may be easily prevented by the
<i>Care</i> and Diligence of the prudent <i>MIDWIFE</i>, stopping
and restraining the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> before it
comes so far to that Extremity: Wherefore <i>she</i> ought
to keep it up in the <i>VAGINA</i> (as much as possible)
with her <span class='sc'>Hands</span>, until the <span class='sc'>Woman</span> has happily extruded
both the <i>CHILD</i> and the <i>AFTER-BIRTH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> This afterwards, <i>she</i> is to use her best Endeavours,
to restore both the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and <i>VAGINA</i> to
their due <i>Situation</i>; laying the <i>Wrinkles Smooth</i> in their
proper <i>Order</i>, not one upon another, then placing the
<span class='sc'>Woman</span> conveniently in <span class='sc'>Bed</span>, with her <i>Head</i> and <i>Shoulders</i>
declining, <i>Exsiccant</i> or <i>drying MEDICINES</i>
are to be judiciously applied, and <i>Strengthening</i> or
<i>Astringent Fomentations</i> often used; whereby (in good
Time) <i>both</i> may be again confirmed in their proper
Natural <i>Places</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> having thus, in fine, candidly explained the
<i>Different Causes</i> of all <i>Difficult BIRTHS</i>, and carefully
laid down the <i>genuine Methods</i> of correcting and removing
them, and consequently of <i>Delivering</i> the good
<span class='sc'>Woman</span> successfully in all such nice <i>Cases</i>, it remains
now in Course that I proceed to——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XII.</span><br /> <i>Of Preternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>SUCH</em> <i>BIRTHS</i>, (properly speaking) are only
<i>Preternatural</i>, which degenerate from the <i>Natural</i>,
in respect either to the <i>Situation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, or the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, or of <i>both</i> these jointly: Such (I say) may be
well call’d <i>Preternatural</i>, because of the imminent
Danger that (in these <i>Conditions</i>) threatens both the
<span class='sc'>Mother</span> and the <span class='sc'>Child</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> we find the Difference between <i>This</i>
and the <i>Natural BIRTH</i>; in as much as the <i>One</i> depends
entirely upon <span class='sc'>Art</span>, and the <i>Other</i> merely upon
<span class='sc'>Nature</span>: In <i>That</i> the <i>INFANT</i> is artificially extracted
by the <i>Hand</i>, but in <i>this</i> it is naturally extruded
by the <i>PAINS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><i><em class='gesperrt'>HIPPOCRATES</em></i> gives<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c017'><sup>[169]</sup></a> us a <i>Two-fold-Cause</i> or
Reason of a <i>Preternatural BIRTH</i>; to wit, the <i>Amplitude</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and the <i>inordinate Motion</i> of the
Woman about the Time of <i>LABOUR</i>: Who, because
of her afflicting <i>PAINS</i> and great <i>Ailments</i>, keeps her
Body in a restless and unsteady <i>Posture</i>, throwing herself
sometimes <i>here</i>, and sometimes <i>there</i>, sometimes on <i>One
side</i>, and sometimes on <i>Another</i> through Uneasiness.
By which means it cannot be otherways, but that the
<i>INFANT</i> may be easily turn’d into some <i>Preternatural
Situation</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> to <i>These Causes</i>, <i>Senertus</i>, <i>Rodericus à Castro</i>,
&amp;c. add the <i>Two</i> following; namely, the <i>Solidity</i> of the
<i>MEMBRANES</i>, and the <i>Debility</i> of the <i>Head</i> of the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i>: Because (as they well observe) when <i>This</i>
is not strong enough to break through <i>Those</i>, the <i>INFANT</i>
endeavouring it otherways, (with <i>Feet</i> or
<i>Hands</i>) may readily fall into some <i>Preternatural Position</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> because I find, that <i>Preternatural BIRTHS</i>
deviate in different Degrees, and vary in many respects
from the <i>Natural</i>, and <i>that</i> also according to a great
Variety of <i>CAUSES</i> (no ways known to those most
<i>Learned Authors</i>) but only of late discovered; I shall
now again reduce the different <i>Species</i> of <i>Preternatural
BIRTHS</i> to four <i>Classes</i>; namely, <i>Preternatural BIRTHS</i>
on Part of the <i>INFANT</i>, on Part of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, on
Part of <i>Both</i> those jointly, and lastly on Part of some
<i>intervening Accidents</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> treating of which, I shall according to my best
Judgment, <i>state</i> these respective <i>HEADS</i> in due Order,
and assign each its proper <i>Branches</i>; which I shall
particularly discuss in brief <i>Terms</i>, for the Facility
and Benefit of the <i>Candid READER</i>, whether <i>MAN</i>
or <i>Woman-Midwife</i>; That they may (by this plain and
easy Method) be enabled the more readily to judge of,
and distinguish the several Circumstances, and consequently
the better discharge their Duties (upon Occasion)
to the Comfort and Satisfaction of those <i>PATIENTS</i>
concerned, and the Honour of their own
ingenious <i>Profession</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> before I enter upon <i>These</i>, I would willingly
in this place, previously subjoin a Word or two of <i>Advice</i>
(by way of <i>Precaution</i>) to the Young <i>Andro-Boethogynist</i>:
Which, in short, consists in this <i>Point</i>, that as
it is the too common <i>Practice</i> here in <i>England</i>, for an
obstinate <span class='sc'>Set</span> of <i>Women</i> to keep their <i>Labouring PATIENTS</i>
so long under their own Hands only, until
the very last <i>Extremity</i>; so I would not counsel him
at that Time, when sent for, upon such a ticklish Occasion,
to go <i>Head-long</i> to such a <i>Work</i>, nor to undertake
the <span class='sc'>Delivery</span> of such a <i>Woman</i>, before He makes
some requisite <i>Observations</i>: And <i>that</i> I mean no ways
because of any Danger of the <i>Preternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>
which she labours under, how difficult soever it may
be; but merely, on account of the <i>Woman</i>’s exhausted
<i>Strength</i> and <i>Ability</i>, to undergo the respective <i>Operation</i>
in her weaken’d <i>Condition</i>; which I would very
much question in most Women, after <i>One</i>, <i>Two</i>, or
<i>Three Hours</i> strong <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Labour</em></span>, and that in <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Some</em></span> far
sooner, notwithstanding that <i>others</i> have been known to
stand it out, and struggle a much <i>longer Time</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, be this as it will, I commonly
guess at the <i>Woman’s State of Ability</i>, not only by her
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pulse</em></span>, if <i>strong</i> or <i>weak</i>, <i>unequal</i> or <i>intermitting</i>; by
her <span class='sc'>Eyes</span>, if <i>dejected</i>; by her <span class='sc'>Speech</span>, if <i>faint</i>; by touching
the <span class='sc'>Extremities</span> of her Body, if <i>frigid</i>: but also by
some other <span class='sc'>Symptoms</span>, which infallibly appear, if the
<i>Woman</i> be too far spent, such as <i>Cold Sweats</i>, <i>Swoonings</i>,
<i>Convulsions</i>, <i>Loss of Sense</i>, &amp;c. Whereupon I say in
these <i>Cases</i>, it is more adviseable to let alone or decline
the <i>Office</i>, than to undertake such a precarious uncertain
Piece of <i>Work</i>; because if the <i>Woman</i> happens to
die under his <i>Hand</i>, He may perhaps be (however unjustly)
blam’d for the errant <i>Midwife</i>’s Faults, or at
least He will scarce avoid the <span class='sc'>Censure</span> of the <i>Ignorant</i>
and <i>Malevolous</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>YET</em> this <i>Advice</i> (however wholesome and prudent)
is, I confess, what I would but seldom have Recourse
to, or follow myself, notwithstanding the worst <i>Consequences</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>of the <i>Case</i>; since as long as there is <i>Life</i>,
there is <i>Hope</i> with me, by the Blessing of <span class='sc'>God</span>: Which
tho’ never so <i>little</i>, I should think myself obliged in
Conscience to do what both <span class='sc'>Art</span> and <span class='sc'>Nature</span> command,
and rather in all <i>Conditions</i> of <span class='sc'>Life</span> to attempt
an uncertain <span class='sc'>Cure</span><a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c017'><sup>[170]</sup></a>, than abandon the <i>Distressed</i> to
certain <span class='sc'>Death</span>, as some <i>Politicians</i> in <i>Physical</i> Affairs
commonly do, who prize their vain <i>Reputation</i> above
the <span class='sc'>Life</span> of their Neighbour. But <i>thus</i>, in short, (for
my own Part) I would chuse to <i>act</i>, because I have
often seen, and known <i>NATURE</i> to have perform’d,
and recover’d a weak spent parturient <span class='sc'>Patient</span>, even
beyond all human Probability.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOT</em> but that I would take the proper <i>Precautions</i>
along with me, before putting my <i>Hand</i> to the
critical <i>Work</i>, upon any such desperate or dangerous
<i>Occasion</i>, by giving my ingenuous <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Prognostick</em></span> to the
nearest <i>Friends</i> and <i>By-standers</i> of the extreme <i>Danger</i>
that both <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lives</em></span> may be in: Whereupon after thoroughly
examining all <i>Circumstances</i>, with respect to the
<span class='sc'>Child</span>, whether <i>One</i> or <i>More</i>, <i>Dead</i> or <i>Alive</i>, &amp;c. I
would chearfully begin my <i>Endeavours</i> to relieve the
afflicted Woman, encouraging and exhorting her in
the first Place, for <span class='sc'>God</span>’s-sake, as well as <i>her own</i>, and
the tender <span class='sc'>Infant</span>’s <i>Life</i>, to put herself entirely into
my <span class='sc'>Hands</span>, to undergo her <span class='sc'>Labour</span> patiently, and contribute
what she can to the <span class='sc'>Delivery</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> to return from this pardonable <i>Digression</i> to
what is here proposed; as I come first to speak of <i>Preternatural
BIRTHS</i> on the part of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, I would
observe that all ill <i>Postures</i> of the <span class='sc'>Child</span>, in a <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
well situated, are the only <i>Causes</i> (meant in this place)
of <i>Preternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em></i> on its <i>own Part</i>: Which
<i>Postures</i> being very various and different, and each requiring
a different peculiar <i>Operation</i>; I shall <i>state</i> them
particularly (as above-mentioned) and <i>that</i> in their
respective <i>Chapters</i>, after the manner following: <i>viz.</i>—</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XIII.</span><br /> <i>Of Præternatural BIRTHS, by the FACE’s being turn’d upwards; or bent forwards, and the CROWN backwards.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>AMONG</em> the many various <i>Preternatural Positions</i>
of the <i>INFANT</i>, I cannot but reckon <span class='sc'>This</span>
<i>One</i>: <span class='sc'>First</span> when, tho’ the <i>CHILD</i> offers itself <i>Head foremost</i>,
yet the <span class='sc'>Face</span> is turn’d upwards; and <i>that</i> because
the <i>INFANT</i> in such a <i>Posture</i> can never be commodiously
bent and adapted to the <i>Form</i> of the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this <i>Case</i>, the <i>MIDWIFE</i> ought to take special
Care, that the <span class='sc'>Head</span> <i>fall down directly</i> and safely, without
being <i>hurt</i>, whilst she endeavours to bring it <i>forward</i>:
For this Purpose, she is to enlarge the <i>Passage</i>
as much as possible, dilating the <i>Privities</i>, and depressing
the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>; which however must be done, without
lifting the <span class='sc'>Head</span> with her <i>Hand</i>, for fear of bruising
the <span class='sc'>Face</span> against the <span class='sc'>Os Pubis</span>. By this Method the
<i>BIRTH</i> (how <i>Preternatural</i> soever) may be pretty well
and easily perform’d.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> because the <i>CHILD</i> can only be said to be
<i>well turn’d</i>, when it comes with its <span class='sc'>Chin</span> leaning upon
its <i>Breast</i>, and its <i>Top</i> or <i>Crown</i> of the <span class='sc'>Head</span> tending
directly to the <i>Orifice</i>; I reckon <span class='sc'>This</span> <i>another Preternatural
Position</i>, when the <i><em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em></i> presents itself with the
<span class='sc'>Crown</span> bent <i>backwards</i>, and consequently with the <span class='sc'>Face</span>
<i>forwards</i>: By reason that in this <i>Case</i>, the <i>Orifice</i> itself
and all the rest of the <i>Passage</i> must be much more dilated,
than in the <i>natural Condition</i>; and the <span class='sc'>Head</span> (being
thus bent <i>backwards</i>) requires more severe <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pains</em></span>
and hard <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Labour</em></span>, to make it slide through the
<i>Passages</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> which <i>Case</i>, the <i>MIDWIFE</i>, having timely discover’d
this <i>Situation</i> by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, ought immediately
(upon the flowing of the <i>Waters</i>) to bend the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Head</em></span>
gently <i>forwards</i> to the <span class='sc'>Breast</span>, all the while adverting
to handle the <span class='sc'>Face</span>, especially the <i>Nose</i> and <i>Eyes</i>, very
tenderly: And to this End, the <i>Woman</i> may be laid
down on her <i>Back</i>, with her <i>Head</i> low; by no means
<i>labouring</i> with the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAINS</em></i>, before the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Head</em></span> of the
<i>CHILD</i> is so conveniently turned: which may be thus
most properly perform’d; <i>viz.</i> By laying the Palm of
the <i>Hand</i> on the <i><em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em></i>’s <i>Breast</i>, near its <i>Throat</i>,
pressing it entirely <i>back</i> towards the <i>Fund</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>;
by which means the <span class='sc'>Head</span> falls <i>forwards</i> of its own
Accord upon the <i>MIDWIFE</i>’s <i>Arm</i>, and <i>she</i> with-drawing
her <i>Hand</i>, will find the <span class='sc'>Head</span> <i>well turn’d</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> supposing the <span class='sc'>Head</span> to be very strictly bent
or pressed <i>back</i>, then the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MIDWIFE</em></i> is to attract it
gently <i>forwards</i> by her <i>Thumb</i>, or <i>Fore-Finger</i> thrust into
its <span class='sc'>Mouth</span>; or by the Points of all <i>Four</i> thrust betwixt
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and the <i>back Part</i> of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>. And thus,
in fine, the <span class='sc'>Head</span> being <i>well Turned</i>, and dextrously
brought into the <i>Passage</i>; the <i>Woman</i> is then to be
placed commodiously for <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>, and to labour her
<i>Best</i> as in other <i>Cases</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> to this <i>Case</i>, I must add, by way
of <i>Remark</i> for the <i>MIDWIFE</i>’s farther Information and
better Government, that, if the <span class='sc'>Head</span> is not brought
into the <i>Passage</i>, as soon as the <i>Waters</i> have flow’d, it
commonly happens, that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hands</em></span> offer themselves
<i>first</i>; which if she do not instantly repel, the <span class='sc'>Head</span> is
turn’d up <i>forwards</i> with the <span class='sc'>Face</span>, near the <i>Chin</i>, upon
the <span class='sc'>Os Pubis</span>; in which <i>Condition</i>, by reason of the <i>Siccity</i>
and <i>Contraction</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, the only Expedient is
to <i>thrust back</i> the <span class='sc'>Arms</span>, and so passing the <i>Hand</i> under
the <i>CHILD</i>’S <i>Breast</i>, to take hold of, and extract it by
the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XIV.</span><br /> <i>Of Præternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>, by the Hand, Elbow, Shoulder, Knees, or Buttocks presenting first.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>CHILD</i> also sometimes offers itself <i>preternaturally</i>
to the <i>Orifice</i>, with its <span class='sc'>Hand</span>, <span class='sc'>Elbow</span>,
<span class='sc'>Shoulder</span>, <span class='sc'>Knees</span>, or <span class='sc'>Buttocks</span> <i>first</i>: In which <i>Condition</i>,
the <span class='sc'>Hand</span> always gives an easier <i>BIRTH</i> than the
<span class='sc'>Elbow</span>, the <span class='sc'>Elbow</span> than the <span class='sc'>Shoulder</span>, the <span class='sc'>Shoulder</span>
than the <span class='sc'>Knees</span>, and the <span class='sc'>Knees</span> than the <span class='sc'>Buttocks</span>:
For the <span class='sc'>Hand</span> being commonly placed near the <i>Head</i>,
it is no great Wonder, if it presents itself <i>before</i>, or <i>along</i>
with it; as sometimes (after <i>Flooding</i>) the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hand</em></span>
may slide together with the <i>Head</i> obliquely to either
<i>Side</i>, and thereby either <span class='sc'>Elbow</span> or <span class='sc'>Shoulder</span> unfortunately
fall into the <i>Passage</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> is one great Reason, why I have before inculcated,
that the <i>MIDWIFE</i> ought to be diligent and
accurate in <i>Touching</i> her Woman, even before the <span class='sc'>Membrane</span>
breaks, that she may thereby discover and prevent
this <i>Case</i>: Which is easily perform’d, either by
<i>repelling</i> the <span class='sc'>Hands</span>, or by pinching the <i>INFANT</i> sensibly
by the <i>Fingers</i>, and then it soon retracts them;
for thus, in short, by moving my own <i>Hand</i> seasonably,
the <span class='sc'>Head</span> (of its own accord) slips of course down into
the <i>Passage</i>. But and if it happens otherways, ’tis
no difficult Matter to <i>turn</i> and bring it down, by directing
my <i>Fingers</i> beyond the <span class='sc'>Face</span> to the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i>’s
<i>Forehead</i>; which however must be done immediately
after <span class='sc'>Flooding</span>: Whereas, if <i>This</i> be neglected until
the <i>dry</i> <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is contracted, <span class='sc'>Then</span>, and in that <i>Condition</i>,
the <i>FEET</i> may be looked for, which (in such a
<i>Posture</i>) are soon found, with the <i><em class='gesperrt'>KNEES</em></i> next the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span><i>Belly</i>; and the <i>INFANT</i> may be readily drawn out by
them. But</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEN</em> it so happens, that the <i>CHILD</i> comes with
its <i>KNEES foremost</i>, it commonly has its <i>LEGS</i> folded
towards the <i>BUTTOCKS</i>; by which means many a
<i>MIDWIFE</i> has been deceiv’d, especially when <i>she</i> feels
but one <i>KNEE</i>, mistaking it for the <i>HEAD</i>, because
of its <i>Hardness</i> and <i>Roundness</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this <i>preternatural Condition</i>, the <i>INFANT</i> must
be stopped and hindered from advancing <i>farther</i>; wherefore
having placed the <i>Woman</i> aright, I would gently
repel the <i>KNEES</i>, that I may the more commodiously
<i>unfold</i> the complicated <i>LEGS</i>, one after another; which
I commonly do by directing <i>one</i> or <i>more Fingers</i> under
the <span class='sc'>Ham</span>, gradually along behind the <i>LEG</i>, until I
come to the <span class='sc'>Foot</span>; drawing always a little <i>obliquely</i>,
that I may come the easier to its <i>Extremity</i>: And thus,
in short, having disengaged the <i>One</i>, I accordingly manage
the <i>Other</i> after the same manner; and by bringing
both <i>FEET</i> at last together, I finish my <i>Work</i>, as if
the <i>Child</i> had come <i><em class='gesperrt'>FEET</em></i> foremost, of which in
course.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em> again it also happens sometimes,
that the <i>CHILD</i> falls with its <i>BUTTOCKS forwards</i>; in
which <i>preternatural Condition</i>, the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> must industriously
prevent it from coming <i>too low</i> in the <span class='sc'>Passage</span>, before
it be duly corrected or rectify’d; since the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> cannot
possibly come, after this manner, into the World;
unless it be very <i>small</i>, and the <i>PASSAGE</i>, on the other
hand, very <i>large</i>. Wherefore in this <i>Case</i>, after the
<i>Woman</i> is decently laid upon her <i>Back</i>, with her <i>Head</i>
declining, I would advise to thrust back the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BUTTOCKS</em></i>
as well as possible; then passing up my <i>Hand</i>
along the <i><em class='gesperrt'>THIGHS</em></i> to the <i>Legs</i>, I would take hold of
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>FEET</em></i>, and bring them gently, and one by one,
forth gradually; which being done, I would attract
them by the <i>HEELS</i> towards the <i>Side</i> as far as the
Length of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BUTTOCKS</em></i>; and then at last taking
good <i>Hold</i> under the <i>HIPS</i>, I would easily and softly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>with the greatest <i>Deliberation</i>, draw out the whole
Body successively.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XV.</span><br /> <i>Of Preternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>, by the Breast, Belly, or Back, presenting first; and the <em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em>’s lying transverse.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>SOMETIMES</em> likewise the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i> offers its
<span class='sc'>Breast</span> or <span class='sc'>Belly</span> <i>first</i>, along with the <i>Navel-string</i>;
which <i>Preternatural Figure</i> is most dangerous for the
<i>BIRTH</i>, because of the <i>Body’s bending backwards</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this difficult <i>Case</i>, the attentive <i><em class='gesperrt'>MIDWIFE</em></i>
places her <i>Woman</i> conveniently, as soon as the <i>Waters</i>
have flow’d, and sliding her <i>Hand</i> into the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, removes
the <i>String</i>, and endeavours to bring the <i>HEAD
forwards</i> into the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PASSAGE</em></i>; which she easily performs,
as long as the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> is suspended on high, and
its <i>Back</i> not too much <i>bent</i>, by putting-in her <i>Hand</i>
gently up to the <i>hinder Part</i> of the <i>CHILD</i>’S <i>Head</i>, attracting
it gradually <i>downwards</i>. But if in this <i>Condition</i>
the <i>BIRTH</i> be fallen too <i>far down</i>, it is more adviseable
<i>first</i> to attract the <i>FEET</i> considerately.</p>

<p class='c005'>I say <i>considerately</i>, because it is not sufficient to penetrate
with the <i>Hand</i> to the <i>FEET</i>; which however
yet, in this <i>Posture</i> is pretty difficult: But also to know
exactly in what manner they are to be <i>drawn down</i>;
since it is no indifferent Matter to understand how that
is to be rightly perform’d with Success. Wherefore I
shall in this place take upon me to set forth <i>two different
Ways of Turning the INFANT</i> in this <i>Condition</i>; viz.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. I would <i>either</i> <span class='sc'>First</span> pass my <i>Right Hand</i> to the
<i>Left Thigh</i> of the <i>CHILD</i>, and taking hold of it near
the <i>KNEE</i>, push it <i>upwards</i> with my <i>Thumb</i>, drawing
it at the same time <i>downwards</i> with my <i>Fingers</i> placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>behind: <i>Thus</i> I would bring <i>down one <em class='gesperrt'>KNEE</em></i> to the
<i>Passage</i>, leaving the <span class='sc'>Foot</span> yet above, and then the <i>other
<em class='gesperrt'>KNEE</em></i> in its Turn; which being done, I would
change my <i>Hand</i>, and put the <i>Left</i> up to the <i>INFANT</i>’s
<i>Belly</i> or <i>Breast</i>; where, as I <i>thrust back</i> its Body <i>upwards</i>,
there is presently <i>Room</i> enough: then I would take
hold again of <i>one</i> or <i>both KNEES</i>, to move the <i>CHILD
higher</i>, that so the <i><em class='gesperrt'>FEET</em></i> may be more conveniently
brought into the <i>Passage</i> one by one, if not <i>Both</i> at
once: Or, upon the <i>LEGS</i> being bent with the <i>Right
Hand</i>, and the <i><em class='gesperrt'>KNEES</em></i> brought into the <i>Passage</i> (as
above) I would take hold of them below the <span class='sc'>Ham</span>,
and bring them past the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, till the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>FEET</em></i> are before the <i>Passage</i>; whereupon I would
then readily endeavour to extract the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> by the
<i>FEET</i>. <i>Or</i>, <span class='sc'>Secondly</span>,</p>

<p class='c005'>II. I would put my <i>Right Hand</i> up along the <i>Belly</i> to
either <span class='sc'>Thigh</span>, or <span class='sc'>Knee</span>, having at the same time a
thin <i>Bandage</i> doubled and dipp’d in <i>Oil</i>, upon my <i>Fingers’
Ends</i>, in order to be put about the <span class='sc'>Knee</span>, that I
may attract it gently thereby; which I would draw out
again by the <i>Right Hand</i>, whilst my <i>Left</i> holds the Ends
of the <i>Bandage</i>, that they may not move out of their
Place: Then I would take the Extremities of the <i>Bandage</i>
in my <i>Right Hand</i>, attracting it softly thereby,
whilst I pass up my <i>Left</i> into the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, to thrust the
<i>CHILD</i>’s <i>Belly upwards</i>. By which ingenious and regular
Means, I think, Dr. <i>Daventer</i> first moved the <i>upper Part</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Body</span> <i>upwards</i>, and the <span class='sc'>Feet</span> <i>downwards</i>, because
the <span class='sc'>Knees</span> are thereby brought nearer to the <i>Orifice</i>.
Now these, in short, are the only safe, and proper <i>Methods</i>
to be taken in this present <i>Case</i>, or nice Conjuncture;
because, by all <i>other</i> inconsiderate and temerarious
<i>Means</i>, the <i>INFANT</i>’s <span class='sc'>Loins</span> may be <i>twisted</i>, its <span class='sc'>Hips</span>
or <span class='sc'>Knees</span> <i>disjointed</i>, its <span class='sc'>Feet</span> <i>lamed</i>, and itself at last
quite lost or destroy’d.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> like manner it happens not very seldom, that
the <i>INFANT</i> comes with its <span class='sc'>Back</span> <i>forwards</i> into the
<i>Passage</i>; and in this <i>Posture</i> the <span class='sc'>Navel-String</span> falls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>commonly down <i>there</i>, so that besides <i>itself</i>, nothing
else is to be felt by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>: In this <i>Case</i>, the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span>
is to observe well the <span class='sc'>Flooding</span>; immediately upon
which, <i>she</i> is to seek for the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>, which are more
easily come at than the <i>HEAD</i>, tho’ the same is even
also a very difficult <span class='sc'>Task</span>, by reason that the <i>CHILD</i>’s
<i>Back</i> takes up the whole Space of <i>Room</i>; which, notwithstanding,
must be cautiously done, and the <i>INFANT</i>
discreetly extracted by <i>them</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> again sometimes, the <i>BIRTH</i> lies also <i>Transverse</i>,
or a-cross the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; in which dangerous <i>Case</i>,
I confess the <i>MIDWIFE</i> cannot well perceive, so as to
distinguish Matters by the <i>Touch</i>, before <i>Flooding</i>:
Because the <i>INFANT</i> (swimming in the <i>Waters</i>) is as
yet seated high, and then moving its <span class='sc'>Hands</span> and <span class='sc'>Feet</span>
variously, <i>she</i> sometimes feels <i>one</i>, and sometimes <i>another
Member</i> at the <i>Orifice</i>; or, one Moment she finds <i>Something</i>,
and another <i>Nothing</i> at all there. However, in
fine, <i>she</i> may perceive the <i>Humours</i> most commonly compressed
into an <i>acuminated</i> or <i>oblong Form</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> in this difficult <i>Preternatural
Condition</i>, the <i>MIDWIFE</i> ought primarily and chiefly
to consider and discover the <i>Posture</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>,
whether it be <i>direct</i> or <i>oblique</i>; since according to <span class='sc'>That</span>
<i>she</i> must proceed in assisting her <i>Woman</i> with true Discretion.
As for <i>Example</i>, if <i>she</i> finds it in a streight or
<i>natural State</i>, and the <i>Waters</i> sufficiently exuberant,
extended <i>length-ways</i>, &amp;c. as aforesaid, <i>She</i> must, without
<i>Loss of Time</i>, break the <i>MEMBRANE</i>, and presently,
removing all <i>Impediments</i> of <i>HAND</i>, <i>FOOT</i>, or
<i>NAVEL-STRING</i>, judiciously direct the <i>HEAD</i> into
the <i>Passage</i>; which may be very easily and safely done
immediately upon the <span class='sc'>Flooding</span>. Whereas if <i>this Method</i>
be delay’d, or not taken in <i>due Time</i>, and consequently
the <i>HANDS</i> (as the readiest) present themselves
to the <i>Orifice first</i>: In this <i>Condition</i>, I would lay
the <i>Woman</i> discreetly upon her <i>Back</i>, with the <i>upper
Part</i> of her Body <i>lowest</i>; after which, I would move
the <i>INFANT</i>’s <i>Hands</i> back with my <i>own</i>; whereby at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the same time bringing its <i><em class='gesperrt'>FEET</em></i> into the <i>Passage</i>, I
would in the next Place gently extract the whole Body
with all possible <i>Conduct</i> and <i>Success</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XVI.</span><br /> <i>Of Preternatural BIRTHS, by the Feet presenting first.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> like manner again, it often happens, that the
<i>CHILD</i> offers its <i>FEET foremost</i>; which next to a
<i>Natural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i> is the most easy and safe <i>Position</i>,
however I have been oblig’d to postpone it to the <i>rest</i>,
for Method’s sake: In this <i>Case</i>, the <i>MIDWIFE</i>, observing
<i>one FOOT</i> presenting itself in the <i>Passage</i> after
<i>FLOODING</i>, ought to stop and retain it <i>there</i>, that it
may not slide through, until <i>she</i> meets with the <i>other</i>.
In order to which Performance, <i>she</i> must immediately
seek for <i>it</i>, with either <i>Hand</i>, according as she perceives
the <i>INFANT</i>’s great <i>Toe</i> situated, since it is
only to be sought for along its <i>Side</i>; and being found,
it is to be gently <i>drawn down</i>, and placed near its <i>Fellow</i>
in the <i>Passage</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> it falls out sometimes, that the <i>MIDWIFE</i>
comes too late, and finds <i>one LEG</i> so far through, that
the <span class='sc'>Buttocks</span> are strictly confin’d: In this <i>Condition</i>, I
would advise to lay the <i>Woman</i> conveniently upon her
<i>Back</i>, with her <i>Head</i> low, that both the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and
the <span class='sc'>Child</span> may <i>retreat</i> a little; then taking hold of the
<i>right <em class='gesperrt'>LEG</em></i> with my <i>Right Hand</i>, I would thrust the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em> back</i>, till the whole <span class='sc'>Foot</span> (or at least the
<span class='sc'>Knee</span>) is brought back into the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
in order that I may have the more <i>Room</i> for passing my
<i>Hand</i> along the <i>LEG</i>: By which means I get hold of
the <i>other</i> <span class='sc'>Foot</span>; and bringing it also into the <i>Passage</i>, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>place it along with the <i>other</i>, that both may come forth
successfully together.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> Thing, happening so when it will, that
<i>both <em class='gesperrt'>FEET</em></i> are excluded, whether done <i>spontaneously</i>
or by <span class='sc'>Art</span>, they are never to be <i>repell’d</i> or <i>thrust back</i>
again; but, on the contrary, the way is to be duly
cleared for their <span class='sc'>Passage</span>; <i>This</i> being a very commodious
<i>Situation</i>, provided the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> be <i>well turned</i>, I
mean, with <i><em class='gesperrt'>HEELS</em></i> and <i>BUTTOCKS upwards</i>, and
<i>TOES</i> and <i>BELLY downwards</i>: Whereas, if otherways,
the <i>CHIN</i> may be easily hooked upon the <i>OSSA PUBIS</i>;
which (if not so happily <i>turned</i> at first) I commonly
prevent in the most adviseable manner following; <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> attracting the <i>INFANT</i>, I <i>turn</i> it cautiously
at the same time, using <i>both Hands</i> in the ensuing
<i>Method</i>; namely, The <i>One</i> I put up under its
<i>Body</i> as far as possible, whilst with the <i>Other</i> I hold both
<i>FEET</i> together: Insomuch that by this Means I gradually
<i>turn</i>, not only the <i>FEET</i> and the <i>LEGS</i>, but
also the <i>whole Body</i>; bringing it always <i>forwards</i> in the
Interim, till at last it lies with its <i>BELLY downwards</i>,
and is <i>out</i> above half way: Upon this I then give my
<i>Woman</i> the Motion, to begin her <span class='sc'>Labour</span> and endeavour
her <i>Best</i>; because the <i>HEAD</i> and <i>ARMS</i> must necessarily
pass through <i>All at once</i>. For notwithstanding the
contrary Opinion of most <i>Authors</i>, who teach us to
draw down the <span class='sc'>Arms</span> <i>one</i> by <i>one</i>, and place them upon
the <i>Body</i>, I cannot but agree with <i>Daventer</i>, and positively
advise in <i>this</i> and all such <i>other like Cases</i>, to leave
the <span class='sc'>Arms</span> about the <i>HEAD</i>, that they may be excluded
along with it: Because, as he says, tho’ the
<i>Woman</i> in so doing, is obliged to force her <i>INFANT
forwards</i> with all possible Endeavours, yet like a small
transient <span class='sc'>Cloud</span>, it is soon over.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> I commonly make it my Business
to prevent the <i>Woman</i>’s <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAINS</em></i>, until I have
brought the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i> this <i>Length</i>; when allowing her
a little Time to rest, I heartily encourage and positively
promise <i>Her</i>, that, she performing her <i>Part</i> effectually,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>(by using all her <i>Strength</i>, and behaving herself
as if the <i>PAINS</i> were most really <i>pressing</i> upon her,
whether so or not) the <i>BIRTH</i> will immediately succeed:
And upon this <i>Promise</i>, with the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i>’s
mutual Assistances concurring, I never yet fail’d; neither
will any <i>Persons</i> who faithfully and ingeniously
follow this <i>Method</i>, in comfortably helping the <i>Woman</i> upon
such an Occasion, by drawing the <i>CHILD</i> cautiously
<i>downwards</i>, with whatsoever judicious <i>Force</i>: I mean
not <i>downwards</i>, according to the <i>Woman</i>’s <span class='sc'>Length</span>, but
<i>downwards</i> towards the <i>strait Gut</i>. And as I every Moment
insinuate to the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MOTHER</em></i>, that her <i>BABE</i>’s
<i>Life</i> depends entirely upon her vigorous confederate
<span class='sc'>Labour</span>; so <i>she</i> mutually concurring with me, in endeavouring
to do our <i>Best</i>, the <span class='sc'>Agrippa</span> <i>INFANT</i> is
presently <i>brought forth</i> to the great Satisfaction of <i>Both</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BY</em> these <i>Means</i> and <i>Methods</i>, we prevent the <i>Tragical
Consequences</i>, which Mr. <i>Portal</i> and many <i>others</i> confess
they have often met with in their <i>Practice</i>; viz. That
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>HEAD</em></i> has been sometimes pulled-off from the
<i>SHOULDERS</i>, or that the <i>CHILD</i> has been frequently
<i>stifled</i>, by the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>’s contracting and shutting-up
about the <i>NECK</i>: Which was altogether owing to the
injudicious <i>Method</i> of their Practice, in drawing down
the <span class='sc'>Arms</span> awkwardly (as mentioned above) along the
<span class='sc'>Sides</span> of the <i>Body</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Case</i> also happens sometimes remarkably;
upon which, if <i>Both</i> or <i>All</i> are contain’d in <i>one</i>
and the <i>same <em class='gesperrt'>SECUNDINE</em></i>, or when the <i>MEMBRANES</i>
are broken, <i>then</i> the right <span class='sc'>Version</span> is very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>difficult; not so much for want of <i>Room</i>, as because
their <i>HANDS</i> and <i>FEET</i> are commonly interwoven
and twisted together: In which <i>preternatural Condition</i>,
when so complicated and entangled, they are to be unfolded
and cleared off <i>one another</i> with the nicest Circumspection
and Judgment.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> besides, farther, they are otherways, only
to be treated in this difficult Point, as if there was
but <i>one CHILD</i>; for <i>turning</i> them always <i>One</i> by <i>One</i>
duly, I would bring all their <span class='sc'>Feet</span> into the <i>Passage</i>,
and consequently handle them, as if they had offer’d
themselves so at <i>first</i>. The <i>first CHILD</i> being born, I
would give it to the next capable <i>Person</i> to tie and
cut its <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>String</em></span>; whilst I directly repass up my
<i>Hand</i>, to seek for the <i>other</i>’s <span class='sc'>Feet</span>, by which I would
also <i>draw it forth</i>, after breaking its proper <i><em class='gesperrt'>MEMBRANES</em></i>,
in Case the <i>second</i> <span class='sc'>Flooding</span> is not yet
over, and <i>that</i> notwithstanding the <span class='sc'>Head</span> should present
itself <i>First</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> and if it happens, that <i>each CHILD</i> has its
own proper and <i>distinct SECUNDINE</i>, and <i>That</i> of the
<i>INFANT</i> already <i>brought forth</i> chance to be loose and
separated from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; In that <i>Case</i>, I would presently
fetch it away, and then extract the <i>other <em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em></i>,
as long as there is <i>any</i> yet left behind, and
<i>that</i> also by the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>, as aforesaid: Whereas otherwise,
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em></i>, together with the <i>Constriction</i> of
their <i>UMBILICALS</i>, are to be previously accomplished.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> fine, having <i>thus</i> accounted for all the <i>Preternatural
BIRTHS</i> whatsoever, which may or can occur on
the <i>Part</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>, and <i>that</i> conformable to the

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XVIII.</span><br /> <i>Of Preternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>, proceeding from Causes of the <em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>MOST</em>, if not all, <i>Authors</i> having hitherto imagin’d,
that all <i>Preternatural BIRTHS</i> took their
sole <i>Rise</i> and <i>Origin</i> from the wrong <i>Positions</i> of the
<i>INFANTS</i> only; I come in this place, with all due
Submission, not only to affirm a quite contrary <i>Opinion</i>,
but also to lay down a directly opposite <span class='sc'>Maxim</span>: Namely,
that the most difficult and dangerous <i>Preternatural
BIRTHS</i> proceed merely from the ill <i>Situation</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>; which I take to be the most common <i>Cause</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Child</span>’s wrong <i>Posture</i>. The Truth of which
I hope to make evidently appear, to all such, who
know and will consider, that this <i>Noble Part</i> is no less
subject to various <i>Accidents</i> and different <i>Diseases</i>, than
the <i>Rest</i> of the <span class='sc'>Body</span>; which springing from divers
<i>Sources</i>, may rationally be suppos’d to occasion <i>Preternatural
BIRTHS</i>, and <i>those</i> more or less dangerous, according
to the <i>Nature</i> of the <span class='sc'>Efficient</span>: as for <i>Instance</i>,</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> <i>Case</i> of an <i>Inflammation</i>, <i>Exulceration</i>, <i>Putrefaction</i>,
or the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>’s being <i>Schirrous</i>, <i>Callous</i>, or <i>Hard</i>; affected
with a <span class='sc'>Carcinoma</span> or <i>Cancer</i>; an obdurated <i>Gland</i>, <i>Cicatrix</i>,
or any <i>carnous Excrescence</i>; or in <i>Case</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>’s being <i>Dry</i> and <i>Rigid</i>, and the <i>Orifice</i>’s being
<i>Hard</i> and <i>Thick</i>, as commonly happens to <span class='sc'>Women</span> <i>in
Years</i>, especially of their <i>First CHILD</i>; I say, from
either of <i>these</i>, or any such like <i>Causes</i>, a <i>Preternatural
BIRTH</i> may ensue, and <i>that</i> even tho’ the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span> and
<span class='sc'>Passage</span> be <i>larger</i>, but much more if <i>those</i> be <i>narrower</i>,
and the Point of the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span> bent <i>Inwards</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>Larger</i> <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, the greatest <i>Difficulty</i> of
this <i>BIRTH</i> proceeds from too great a <i>Descent</i> of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span><span class='sc'>Womb</span>; which relaxes the <i>Ligaments</i> and <i>Fibres</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Vagina</span>, and so much depresses the <i>Bladder</i>, that an
<i>Incontinency</i> of <span class='sc'>Urine</span> presently follows, which in this
<i>Case</i> is commonly succeeded by a <i>Falling Down</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> or <span class='sc'>Vagina</span>, as already observ’d in <i>Chap.</i> XI.
where the Diligent <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> will find the due <i>Method</i>
of preventing such growing <i>Mischiefs</i>, and of opening
the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> both safely and readily, and
consequently <i>Delivering</i> her <i>Woman</i> more easily and expeditiously,
with good Success as well as Security.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i>narrower</i> <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, the <i>MIDWIFE</i> needs
no ways fear the above-named <i>Accident</i>, and therefore
is not to be at so much Pains in <i>retaining</i> the <span class='sc'>Orifice</span>
in its proper Place, whatever Trouble she may have
in <i>opening</i> it; which would be no easy <span class='sc'>Task</span>, was not
the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span> to be <i>thrust back</i>, (as set forth, <i>Chap.</i>
IX.) And which I must (for this Reason) recommend
once more to all Careful <i>MIDWIVES</i>, as the best and
most effectual <span class='sc'>Method</span> of performing this happy <i>Apertion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> what is said here therefore, we may now
conclude, that a great <i>Variety</i> of <span class='sc'>Causes</span> may subject
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> to a Diversity of <span class='sc'>Accidents</span>, and <i>those</i> of
sundry <i>Degrees</i>, which may more or less affect its <i>Motion</i>
and <i>Situation</i>, as already set forth<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c017'><sup>[171]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> hence it is that we have so many <i>Degrees</i> of
<i>Preternatural BIRTHS</i> on <i>Part</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, <i>All</i> which
to enumerate particularly in this Place, would be a
<span class='sc'>Work</span> as <i>Superfluous</i> as <i>Tedious</i>: wherefore, to be brief,
I shall here also reduce them to the <span class='sc'>Four</span> following,
(as before mentioned, <span class='sc'>Sect.</span> IV. <i>Chap.</i> 13.) viz. <i>Preternatural
BIRTHS</i>, proceeding from an <i>oblique Situation</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> inclining <i>Forwards</i>, or <i>Backwards</i>, or to
(either <i>Side</i>) <i>Right</i> or <i>Left</i>: which fourfold <i>Situation</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> may be rightly and properly compar’d to the
<i>Four Cardinal Points</i> of the <span class='sc'>Compass</span>, as the rest of its
<i>oblique Positions</i> may be analogously adequated to the <i>Collateral</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>and <i>Middle Points</i>: For because, as they decline
from the <i>Meridian</i>, and derive themselves from <span class='sc'>East</span>,
<span class='sc'>West</span>, <span class='sc'>North</span>, and <span class='sc'>South</span>, as formerly observ’d<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c017'><sup>[172]</sup></a>;
so <i>those</i> are less difficult <i>BIRTHS</i>, and branch out
from the <i>Four</i> mentioned Extremities: since the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
like a <i>Magnetick Needle</i>, may run quite round, and be
ill-seated every way, or on every <i>side</i>. In all which
<i>Cases</i>, the <i>INFANT</i> must absolutely be <i>Turned</i>; which
<i>Performance</i> in any <i>oblique</i> <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, requires a competent
solid <i>Knowledge</i> and sound <i>Judgment</i>, as well as the best
adapted and experienced <i>Hands</i>. But of <i>those</i>, more
particularly hereafter; and <i>First</i>, accordingly——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XIX.</span><br /> <i>Of Preternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>, from the WOMB’s inclining Forwards.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> speaking to this critical <i>Point</i>, I shall <i>first</i> give
the <i>Reason</i> of such a <i>BIRTH</i>, occasion’d by this
<i>Position</i>; to wit, The <i>WOMB</i> hanging much <i>forwards</i>,
especially in <i>Women</i> carrying it too <i>low</i> in the <span class='sc'>Abdomen</span>,
the <i>INFANT</i> (betwixt the <i>Pains</i>) must needs be
forced upon the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>, or the <span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span> bending
<i>inwards</i>; which stops the <span class='sc'>Head</span> that it cannot conveniently
or without Obstruction fall into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, in this <i>Condition</i> we suppose the
<i>INFANT</i> to be <i>well turn’d</i>, I mean (both <i>here</i> and <i>elsewhere</i>)
<i>well turn’d</i> in respect of the <i>WOMB</i>, with the
<i>Crown</i> of the <span class='sc'>Head</span> lying against the <i>Orifice</i>; than which
nothing can be more <i>Right</i> or <i>Natural</i> in regard of the
<i>WOMB</i> itself, nor more <i>Wrong</i> and <i>Preternatural</i> in respect
of the <i>PELVIS</i> and <i>Vagina</i> of the <i>WOMB</i>, in
this <i>forward Situation</i>: Because by reason of this <i>Posture</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>the <i>INFANT</i> falls <i>transverse</i> upon the <span class='sc'>Ossa Pelvis</span>,
especially upon the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span> or <i>hindmost</i> <span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span>;
upon which it commonly offers itself with the <span class='sc'>Face</span>
<i>prone</i> or <i>turn’d Downwards</i>, tho’ it is not brought forth,
but with the <span class='sc'>Face</span> <i>Supine</i> or <i>Upwards</i>. For as it passes,
it must be <i>turn’d round</i>, partly in a <i>Circle</i>, with its
<span class='sc'>Head</span> <i>prone</i>, and <span class='sc'>Feet</span> drawn up under it; which happens
not in the <i>WOMB</i>, but only as it passes the <i>Orifice</i>
into the <i>PELVIS</i> or <i>VAGINA</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> what I mean is more plainly <i>This</i>, that as
soon as the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> comes into the <i>Turning</i> (which it
must pass) it necessarily <i>bends</i> and <i>crooks</i> itself, as it finds
its <span class='sc'>Passage</span> <i>bent</i> or <i>crooked</i>; by which means the <span class='sc'>Face</span>
is sometimes <i>turn’d down</i>, and sometimes <i>upwards</i>: And
<i>This proceeds</i> from <span class='sc'>That</span>, in short, as soon as the <span class='sc'>Head</span>
begins to enter the <i>Orifice</i>, it presently fixes upon (and
sticks fast to) the last <span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span> of the <i>Loins</i> standing
<i>forwards</i>, or to the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>; so that it cannot naturally
or possibly go <i>forwards</i>, except the <span class='sc'>Head</span> is <i>bent
downwards</i>, and the <i>Neck</i> and whole <i>Body</i> be accommodated
to that <span class='sc'>Bending</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> it is, that <i>THAT</i> which just now was
<i>situated prone</i> upon its <span class='sc'>Belly</span> in the <i>WOMB</i>, now passing
through the <i>VAGINA</i>, is <i>bent upwards supine</i> upon
its <i>BACK</i>; and from thence it’s evident, that <i>That Inversion</i>
is not properly in the <i>WOMB</i>, but in the <i>VAGINA</i>,
or (if you please) in the <i>Confines</i> of <span class='sc'>Both</span>:
And, in fine, this <i>forward Inversion</i> (as it happens) occasions
a most difficult <i>Preternatural BIRTH</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> <i>this</i>, in short, happens to the <i>Woman</i> with
<i>CHILD</i>, because her <i>WOMB hangs forward</i>, or is <i>resupin’d</i>,
according to the <i>Depression</i> made on the <i>WOMB</i>
by the <i>Intestines</i>, forcing it <i>this</i> or <i>that way</i>; or to either
<i>Side</i>, as will by and by more fully appear<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c017'><sup>[173]</sup></a>. But——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SINCE</em> it is most requisite to know presently in
the <i>Beginning</i> of <i>LABOUR</i>, whether the <i>WOMB</i> be
placed <i>forwards</i>, in order that the Means of Help may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>be taken accordingly; I shall in the <i>second place</i> add the
<i>SIGNS</i>, or <i>Tokens</i>, by which the <i>MIDWIFE</i> may
know this <i>Position</i> of the <i>WOMB</i>, and what <i>she</i> has best
to do in such a nice ticklish <i>STATE</i> of Affairs.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em> then, <i>She</i> may know it, principally, by
the <i>Hanging forwards</i> and <i>Thickness</i> of the <span class='sc'>Belly</span>, or
perhaps by the good <i>Woman’s Information</i> of the <span class='sc'>Place</span>,
where she chiefly feels the <i>INFANT</i> stirring; for it
cannot <i>move</i> but where ’tis <i>placed</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet a prudent <i>MIDWIFE</i> will
have no great regard to such <i>Uncertainties</i>, but betake
herself immediately to <i>that</i> which cannot fail her, the
<span class='sc'>Touch</span>; which (in this <i>Case</i>) affords her the following
certain <i>SIGNS</i>; viz.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is suspended <i>higher</i>
than usual; which <i>she</i> cannot <i>Touch</i>, by reaching, without
a great deal of <i>Difficulty</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> can only <i>Touch</i> the lower Border of the
<i>Orifice</i>, and that only as the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> hangs more or less
<i>forwards</i>; and by no means the <i>upper Edge</i>, except the
<i>Orifice</i> has begun to <i>fall down</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> cannot at all, or very hardly, get her
<i>Finger</i> into the opening of the <i>Orifice</i>, and because of
that Difficulty, it must then also be <i>crooked</i> or <i>bent</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> will find the <i>Orifice</i> opposite to the <i>bending</i>
of the last <span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span> or the <span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>, and feel it so
strongly pressed against the said <span class='sc'>Vertebræ</span>, when the
<i>Pains</i> come on, that it cannot <i>fall down</i>: and lastly,
she’ll feel the <span class='sc'>Waters</span> (if they hang over the <i>Passage</i>)
in a thin <i>slender Form</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> <i>This</i> the Skilfull <i>MIDWIFE</i> finding these
concurring <i>SIGNS</i>, <i>she</i> may be assur’d that the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
hangs too much <i>forwards</i>; which <i>Condition</i> requires the
immediate <i>Help</i> of <i>Ingenuity</i> and <i>ART</i> to correct this ill
untoward <i>Position</i>, and to promote the <i>BIRTH</i> expeditiously.
But then <i>these Things</i> are to be carefully perceived
and distinguished in the <i>Beginning</i> of <span class='sc'>Labour</span>,
before the <span class='sc'>Pains</span> have either closed up, or too much
depressed the <i>Orifice</i>; yea, in short, even before it sensibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span><i>opens</i>: since afterwards all those <i>SIGNS</i> are variously
chang’d and alter’d, till at last they entirely
<i>vanish</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> let it be deem’d as a certain
<i>Rule</i>, that the true <i>Posture</i> of the <i>WOMB</i> is always best
discover’d by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span> in the <i>Beginning</i> of the <span class='sc'>Labour</span>:
At which time may the <i>Orifice</i> be suspended never
so <i>high</i>, the <i>MIDWIFE</i> ought to penetrate so far,
until <i>she reaches</i> it; if not sufficiently with her <span class='sc'>Fingers</span>,
the <i>whole Hand</i> is to be judiciously used, and passed up
that Length, because this particular <span class='sc'>Touch</span> is absolutely
Necessary for that good End: Insomuch that if
any <i>Labouring Woman</i> be against this <i>manual Operation</i> or
opposes it, <i>she</i> thereby debars her <i>MIDWIFE</i> of an infallible
<i>Method</i>, of discovering the true <i>Posture</i> of her
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and consequently of taking the most immediate
proper <span class='sc'>Means</span> for <i>Her own</i> as well as her <span class='sc'>Infant</span>’s
Relief.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> now supposing, after all, the <i>MIDWIFE</i> to
be certain that the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> <i>hanging too much forwards</i>, in a
prominent <span class='sc'>Belly</span> bearing pretty much out, is deeper
depressed than it ought to be; <i>She</i> is obliged then in
this <i>Circumstance</i> to consider accordingly how to correct
this <i>Preternatural Situation</i>, and assist both the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>
and <span class='sc'>Infant</span> for the best: To which End, <i>She</i> ought
<span class='sc'>First</span> to endeavour that the <span class='sc'>Head</span> may <i>fall down</i> into
the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, even to the <i>bending</i> of the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>;
and then, <span class='sc'>Secondly</span>, <i>She</i> is thence to advance the <span class='sc'>Head</span>
gradually, that the <i>Exclusion</i> of the <i>CHILD</i> may be expedited
and intirely perfected at last.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> in order that the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, together with the
<i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, may be so discreetly brought <i>forwards</i>
into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, the <i>Woman</i> is to be placed with
the <i>upper part of her Body lower than the inferiour</i>; I mean,
with <i>Head and Shoulders bending downwards</i>, and the
<i>Buttocks upwards</i>; by which Means, the <i>Bottom</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> is elevated, and gives the <i>Orifice</i> an Opportunity
of being brought more easily into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span><em class='gesperrt'>THEN</em> the parturient <i>Woman being so placed</i>, the
<i>MIDWIFE</i> (using both <i>Hands</i>) ought to clear the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, together with the <i>Head</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, by putting
the <i>one</i> up, as far as there’s occasion, into the
<span class='sc'>Vagina</span>, and laying the <i>other</i> upon the <i>Woman</i>’s <span class='sc'>Belly</span>,
in manner following: <i>viz.</i>——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Hand</i> in the <span class='sc'>Vagina</span> is (by having two or
three of its <i>Fingers Ends</i> extended to the upper Border
of the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>) to move it a little beyond
the <i>Head</i> of the <i>CHILD</i>, and to direct it into the <i>Mouth</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, so that it may fall the more readily
down into the design’d Place. But in this critical
Juncture the <i>MIDWIFE</i> must always take special <i>Care</i>
not to squeeze or press the <i>Top</i> of the <span class='sc'>Head</span> too much,
nor to handle it too hard, lest <i>She</i> should thereby <i>wound</i>,
if not also <i>kill</i> the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AGAIN</em> the Business of the <i>other Hand</i>, used externally,
is to <i>drive back</i> the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, by pressing the
<i>Abdomen</i>; which must be perform’d also with great
Caution and Judgement, not by drawing the <span class='sc'>Hand</span>
from <i>above downwards</i>, but pressing as much as the <i>Woman</i>
can bear it, from <i>below upwards</i>; so that (if possible)
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> may be thereby <i>resupin’d</i> or turn’d <i>backwards</i>.
Minding always, by the way, that</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Pressure</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is not to be attempted,
before the <i>one Hand</i> is first conveniently placed
<i>within</i>. But if all <i>This Menage</i> should not yet succeed
the <i>first time</i> according to Wish, then it may be safely
repeated again by turns so often, until the <i>MIDWIFE</i>
feels the <i>Crown</i> of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>; that is to say, till <i>She</i>
feels the Borders of the <i>Orifice</i> quite round about <i>hanging
over the Entrance of the</i> <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>. Upon which happy
<i>Discovery</i>, she may with reason rejoice in her <i>Labour</i>,
and be heartily glad of her good <i>Success</i>: Because now
the <i>Force</i> of good depressing <span class='sc'>Pains</span> only will effectually
perfect the Work.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> before Matters are happily brought this prepared
<i>Length</i>, the <i>bearing Woman</i> is upon no account
to begin her <i>LABOUR</i>; since <i>That</i> would not only be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>in <i>vain</i>, and otherways debilitate the Strength of her
Body; but also be of great <i>Hindrance</i> to the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span>
(to whom all the <i>LABOUR</i> hitherto belongs) who, as
<i>she</i> feels the <i>PAINS</i> growing and rushing in upon the
<i>Woman</i>, before their proper Time, ought to charge
her strictly, to forbear <i>working</i> along with them, and
as much as possible to abstain from any <i>co-operating
Depression</i>. And in fine, as the <i>MIDWIFE</i> by having her
<i>Hand</i> diligently apply’d to the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, by
strict Attention, may most commonly observe, and previously
discern the approaching <i>PAINS</i>, before the
Patient <i>Woman</i> herself can be sensible of them: So
she ought also for her <i>own helping Part</i>, <i>ex Officio</i>, to be
quiet and attempt nothing till <i>Then</i>, but take her convenient
<i>Opportunities</i>, always as soon as the <i>PAINS</i>
are over.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> by seasonably lending <span class='sc'>Nature</span> an artificial
<i>helping Hand</i>, <span class='sc'>Both</span> <i>jointly</i> may easily effect, what <i>neither</i>
can do <i>separately</i>: For as it sometimes happens, that the
<i>MIDWIFE</i> ought to <i>cease</i>, while she perceives (by the
<span class='sc'>Pains</span>) that <i>Nature</i> is a working, and therefore ought to
<i>work</i> only when the <i>PAINS</i> are past; so it also falls
out often, upon other Occasions, that <i>she</i> is to <i>work</i>
along with the <i>PAINS</i>, and when those are <i>past</i>, to
<i>cease</i>. And thus, in fine, according to different <i>Circumstances</i>,
the discreet <i>MIDWIFE</i> knows always the
<span class='sc'>Needfull</span>, <i>what’s to be done</i>, or <i>let alone</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in this Place, I doubt not, many <i>MIDWIVES</i>
will object, and say, How is it possible for <i>Us</i>
to perceive the <i>PAINS</i> coming on before the parturient
<i>Woman herself</i>? To which I ingenuously <i>answer</i>, that
<i>This</i> also is one of the many Advantages of the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>;
since by <i>That</i>, I can presently feel a kind of <i>subtile Motion</i>,
<i>Contraction</i>, or <i>Compression</i> beginning in the <i>Orifice</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; which is only observable as the <i>Muscles</i>
are affected with a <i>New Sense</i>, excited by a <i>New Influx</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Spirits</span>; occasioning a <i>New Force</i> or <i>Impression</i>
upon the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, which we commonly call a <span class='sc'>Pang</span>:
So that, in short, by distinguishing <i>this Motion</i> from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span><i>others</i>, I am always able to foretell or advise the <i>Woman</i>
of what is a-coming, and to admonish her accordingly
of her bounden <span class='sc'>Duty</span>, as the <i>Case</i> requires.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MATTERS</em> now being fairly brought thus far,
that the <i>Orifice</i> and the <span class='sc'>Head</span> begin to slide down into
the <i>PELVIS</i>; the <i>MIDWIFE</i> is at this Time to study
how to succour and assist the <i>CHILD</i>, by rendring its
<i>Passage</i> easy. In order to which, <i>she</i> must first observe
to raise the <i>upper Part</i> of the Woman’s Body a little,
and give her some short <i>Respite</i>, before she offers to bring
the <i>Orifice</i> into the <i>PELVIS</i>; because the <i>Posture</i> above-directed,
occasions considerable <i>Pain</i> as well as great
Inconveniency: Which being done, the <i>Woman</i> for
the future is to <i>sympathize</i> with every <i>PAIN</i>, and <i>Labour</i>
as much as possible, co-operating mutually with
them; since now the <span class='sc'>Pains</span> (by the Assistance of the
<span class='sc'>Head</span>) begin to open the <i>Orifice</i>, and gradually force
the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> forward to its <i>Birth</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet the <i>MIDWIFE</i> ought in this
<i>Case</i>, to be very careful in sustaining, and nice in
keeping up the <i>Orifice</i> of the <i>Womb</i>, lest it should <i>fall
down</i> together with the <i>Vertex</i> or <i>Crown</i> of the <i>HEAD</i>
into the <i>Sinus Sacri</i>; which is a <i>Point</i> so curious and
critical, tho’ an <i>Accident</i> too common, that I dare well
say, not one in <i>Fifty Practitioners</i> in <i>MIDWIFERY</i> understands
it thoroughly; otherways I am confident, and
morally certain, that many <i>fine Women</i> would have been
<i>living Monuments</i> of their <i>Ingenuity</i>, who are at this day
only the <i>Dead Remains</i> of their <i>Ignorance</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> I think is past all <i>Contradiction</i>, when we
consider, how some <i>Practisers</i> sacrifice the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, first
by <i>opening</i>, and (as they call it) <i>braining</i> the <span class='fss'>HEAD</span>,
and then by drawing it forth with their <i>Instrument</i>
call’d <i>FORCEPS</i>: How <i>others</i> also esteem themselves
<i>Masters</i> of the greatest <i>ARCANUM</i>, boasting that
they can, without so much as <i>braining</i> the <i>HEAD</i>,
extract the <i><em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em></i> by their <i>Tool</i> call’d an
<i>EDUCTOR</i>: How a <i>Third Set</i> again pretending themselves
to be the only <i>genuine Sons</i> of <span class='sc'>Apollo</span>, come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>slily to correct the <i>Rest</i>, by fixing only a couple of
<span class='sc'>Hooks</span> in the <i>Eyes</i>, <i>Ears</i>, or somewhere else in the
Child’s <i>HEAD</i>; by which means they as wretchedly
produce the <i>innocent</i> dead <i>Babe</i> as any of the <i>others</i>:
For it can no more be suppos’d to <i>survive</i> this cruel
<i>Treatment</i>, than the other mentioned <i>Barbarities</i>; not to
speak of the <i>Anguish</i> and <i>Perplexity</i> over and above,
besides the real Danger all the while brought upon
the <i>distressed Mother</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> this grand Affair of Life and Death,
the Desidious and Capricious <i>MIDWIFE</i> cries at
length, <span class='sc'>God</span> knows I have taken all the <i>Pains</i> and
Care I could, but to no <i>Purpose</i>, for this or that trifling
<i>Reason</i>, falsely alledged. The <i>SURGEON</i> (if he
don’t pretend the <i>CHILD</i> to be already <i>Dead</i>) says,
Come, it is better to dispense with <i>one Life</i> than <i>Two</i>;
<i>One must go</i>, &amp;c. In consequence of which, he prepares
his <i>FORCEPS</i>, <i>EDUCTOR</i>, <i>KNIVES</i>, <i>HOOKS</i>,
&amp;c. to draw out the <i>INFANT Dead</i>, or <i>Alive</i>,
<i>Whole</i> or in <i>Pieces</i>, by such disingenuous and barbarous
<i>Means</i> to save the <i>MOTHER</i>. Thus behold the excellent
<i>Art</i> of <i>MIDWIFERY</i> ignorantly perverted!
O Deplorable Woman! O Miserable Babe! How
much abused! when there is no <i>other Mean</i> left to
rescue the tender <i>Life</i> of the poor <i>Mother</i>, but by the
massacrous <i>Death</i> of her dearest <i>CHILD</i>! This <i>Case</i>
indeed would be very <i>Melancholy</i>, but Glory be to <i>GOD</i>
who has neither left the <i>One</i> nor the <i>Other</i> to perish
at this untimely or inhuman Rate, excepting it be
by <i>Ignorance</i>, or <i>Wilfulness</i>, &amp;c. as aforesaid: No, on the
contrary he has provided an <i>EXPEDIENT</i> for every
<i>Extremity</i>, and a <i>REMEDY</i> for every <i>Malady</i>, as in
the present <i>Case</i> will appear farther by what follows,
<i>Viz.</i>——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> such <i>Tragical Events</i> may be prudently
prevented, I use my constant and unwearied Endeavours
to sustain the <i>Orifice</i>, that it may not come below
its proper <i>Place</i>; and that having clear’d the <i>HEAD</i>
of the <i>WOMB</i>, I may only bring <i>it</i> alone down;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>which I can much more easily do, than if it was cover’d
about with the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, sticking fast (as above)
in the <i>SINUS SACRI</i>. And supposing the <i>MEMBRANE</i>
to press strongly instead of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, I treat
it all one as if it was the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, taking always Care
not to <i>break</i> it, tho’ the <i>forming</i> of the <i>WATERS</i> is
not to be obstructed; for which Cause, I upon all
Occasions stretch out my <i>Fingers</i> wide, applying them
only to the Edges of the <i>Orifice</i>, not to the <i>Membrane</i>:
And this I continue doing, until the <i>MEMBRANE</i>
spontaneously <i>breaks</i>; upon which I manage the <i>Head</i>
as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> the <i>Infant’s HEAD</i> being excluded with the
<i>Crown foremost</i>, there is no more Occasion to be at any
Pains in <i>keeping up the Orifice</i>; wherefore I now suffer
it, together with the <i>HEAD</i>, to <i>fall down</i> past the
<i>Bending</i> of the <i>OS SACRUM</i>; which now also, the
<i>major Part</i> of it being bare, more easily happens, than
it possibly could whilst it was cover’d with the <i>Orifice</i>.
Upon this, that the <span class='sc'>Child</span> may be farther relieved and
brought out, I now again make use of both <i>Hands</i>,
the <i>one</i> inwardly, the other <i>outwardly</i>, as before: But
as the <i>Condition</i> is now much <i>alter’d</i> from what it was
at that time, I at present proceed after a quite <i>different
Manner</i>, and work along with the <span class='sc'>Pains</span>, <i>resting</i> only as
their <i>Force</i> ceases: For thus I not only observe the <span class='sc'>Pains</span>
my self, but also at the same time encourage my <i>Woman</i>
to <i>Labour</i>, and to persist in her <i>LABOUR</i> with all her
Strength; and by Turns, as the <i>PAINS</i> come on, to
conjoin their <i>Force</i> with her own and my mutual <i>Endeavours</i>,
in the manner following: namely,</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HAVING</em> <i>One Hand</i> in the <i>Vagina</i>, with its <i>Back</i>
turn’d towards the <span class='sc'>Rectum</span>, I thrust very cautiously
the Points of my <i>Fingers</i> as far as I can under the
<i>HEAD</i>, where I hold that <i>Hand</i> constantly, until the
<i>PAIN</i> comes on; laying the <i>other Hand</i> upon the
<i>Belly</i>, about that Part where the <i>Bottom</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
lies: Then as I perceive the <i>PAINS</i> come on, I
begin to work with both <i>Hands</i>; to wit, by pressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>the <i>internal Hand</i> gently <i>downwards</i>, against the Point
of the <span class='sc'>Sacrum</span> to remove it <i>back</i> out of the way;
whilst by the <i>external Hand</i>, I gently raise the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
into a <i>resupine Posture</i>, pressing it also softly <i>downwards</i>:
I mean <i>softly</i> in Proportion (howsoever) to the <i>Force</i> of
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAIN</em></i>: for as it gradually <i>encreases</i>, and more and
more excites strong <span class='sc'>Labour</span>; so I also by degrees <i>press
down more strongly</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet the <i>External Depression</i> ought
always to be <i>Moderate</i>, as the <i>Internal</i> ought to be <i>Strong</i>
and <i>Vigorous</i>: Whereupon <i>Matters</i> being carefully well
observ’d, (as laid down in <i>Chap.</i> 9.) no <i><em class='gesperrt'>MIDWIFE</em></i>
needs be afraid of <i>hurting</i> her <i>Patient Woman</i> in the
least; no rather, on the contrary, the more <i>Strength</i> I
use now, the more grateful and agreeable I prove to
<i>Her</i> being thus circumstantiated. And, in fine, the <i>upper
Part</i> of the <i>CHILD</i>’s Body being once past that
<i>Sinuous Bending</i> above, it presently breaks out all together,
and comes away so happily into the World. After
which the <i>MIDWIFE</i> is only farther to behave
herself with respect to both the <span class='sc'>Mother</span> and the <span class='sc'>Child</span>,
as in the <i>Natural Case</i><a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c017'><sup>[174]</sup></a>, carefully cleansing, restoring,
contracting, and shutting the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> as <i>Before</i>. In a
Word, with so great Success at last the <i>BIRTH</i> is accomplished,
provided these <i>Precepts</i> be carefully and
timely observed.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> that the <i>Ingenious</i> may be at no <i>Loss</i> in this
momentous Affair upon any Occasion, we shall now
particularly <i>state</i> the <span class='sc'>Case</span>, in which the ordinary <span class='sc'>Midwife</span>
has thro’ Ignorance or Negligence, let <i>Matters</i> come
so far, that the <i>acuminated</i> or <i>lower Part</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is
fallen into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>; and the <i>Orifice</i>, together with
the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, is broken thro’ into the <i>crooked Sinus</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Os Sacrum</span>, and is fixed-up there; that the <span class='sc'>Membrane</span>
is <i>broke</i>; that the <i>Infant</i>’s <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Head</em></span> is but a little <i>bare</i>;
that the poor <i>Woman</i> (after the <i>Fatigues</i> of a strong or
long <i>Travail</i>) is quite spent and tired; and <i>finally</i>, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>all these Things have <i>happen’d</i> before the extraordinary
<i><em class='gesperrt'>MIDWIFE</em></i> is perhaps sent for, or at least before He
can conveniently be with the <i>Woman</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this Pitiful <i>Case</i>, the <span class='sc'>Head</span> being yet but a little
<i>bared</i>, and sticking fast in the <i>Sinus</i> of the <span class='sc'>Os Coccygis</span>
(as abovesaid) the <i>CHILD</i> cannot possibly make any
<i>Impression</i> upon the <i>Orifice</i>, so as to open it; and therefore
the <i>Situation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is to be alter’d: In order
to which, I first place the <i>Woman</i> on a commodious
<i>Seat</i> adapted to the Purpose, such as upon a <i>Pallet</i>, or
<i>Low Bed</i>, or some <i>Pillows</i> laid on the Ground; that she
may lie with her <span class='sc'>Face</span> <i>downwards upon her Knees</i>, with
her <i>Head low</i>; her <i>Arms</i> being supported with so many
<i>Pillows</i> as are requisite to sustain her <i>Body</i> (leaning upon
them) without moving.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> I doubt not but some People will think this
a <i>strange helpless Posture</i>; but as strange as it is, it is certainly
the most <i>effectual</i>, and the <i>absolute best One</i>, which
can be devis’d for the <i>Woman</i>’s desir’d <i>Relief</i> in this
desperate <i>Condition</i>: For by the Help and Means of it,
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is carried down into the <i>lowest Part of the
Belly</i>, through its own <i>Weight</i> only; and consequently
releases itself out of the foremention’d <i>crooked</i> <span class='sc'>Sinus</span>;
which that it may the sooner and more commodiously
do, I put my <i>Fingers</i> into the <i><em class='gesperrt'>VAGINA</em></i> behind, betwixt
the <span class='sc'>Rectum</span> and the <span class='sc'>Head</span> of the <i>Infant</i>, where
I press down the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, till the <i>Orifice</i> is so far <i>forced
back</i>, that there is <i>Room</i> enough to hold it up, in order
that it may not relapse; and also that there may be
<i>Room</i> for the <span class='sc'>Head</span> to be depressed into, and open the
<i>Orifice</i>. Thus the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> and the <i>CHILD</i> being at last
<i>forced so far back</i>, by an expert <i>Hand</i>, the <i>BIRTH</i> may
be successfully perfected by the above-prescrib’d <i>Means</i>
and <i>Method</i>; provided always that the <i>Woman</i> has sufficient
<i>Strength</i> and <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAINS</em></i> to carry her through the
fatiguing <i>Tryal</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> we will how suppose, for better Instruction-sake,
her <i>Strength</i> to be quite spent, and the <i>PAINS</i>
to be deficient; in this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Case</em></span> the happy <i>Issue</i> of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span><i>BIRTH</i> is most dubious; but however, then I place the
<i>Woman</i> again as before, and depress the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> as much
as I can, until I reduce the <i>Orifice</i> farther up into the
<i>larger Space</i> of the <i>PELVIS</i>, that I may the more conveniently
<i>open</i> it by the Help of an <i>inward Hand</i>; and
by <i>that</i> also moving aside the <i>Child</i>’s <span class='sc'>Head</span>, I then seek
for, until I find, the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>; which, upon the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>’s
being right turn’d, with its <span class='sc'>Toes</span> <i>downwards</i> towards
the <i>Mother</i>’s <span class='sc'>Rectum</span>, I bring into the <i>Passage</i>. Now
the <span class='sc'>Feet</span> being thus in the <i>Passage</i>, the <i>Woman</i> needs
not lie any longer in the abovesaid <i>Posture</i>; but, turning
herself, may now lie with her <span class='sc'>Face</span> <i>upwards</i>: When
I also give her previous <i>Notice</i> to prepare herself to <i>depress</i>
vigorously; I mean as much as she can possibly,
when occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the Interim, holding the <span class='sc'>Feet</span> all the while with
my <i>internal Hand</i>, I attract them gently <i>outwards</i>, until
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Buttocks</em></span> and the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Belly</em></span> are excluded: Then
taking fast hold of the <i>CHILD</i> by <i>one Hand</i> under the
<span class='sc'>Belly</span>, and the <i>other</i> upon its <span class='sc'>Back</span>; I advise the good
<i>Woman</i>, in <i>Case</i> she feels no <i>PAIN</i>, to behave herself
as if the <i>PAINS</i> were most pressing upon <i>Her</i>, and to
contribute by <i>forcing downwards</i> what lies in her Power;
whilst I continually <i>attract</i>, and gently <i>draw</i> the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>
towards me, until by this discreet <i>Management</i> the
<span class='sc'>Head</span> is totally excluded, together with the <span class='sc'>Arms</span> into
the World. And <i>thus</i> at length the <i>Distressed Woman</i>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XX.</span><br /> <i>Of Preternatural BIRTHS, from the WOMB’s inclining backwards.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>Experience</em> teaches us, that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>
may be also too much <i>resupin’d</i>; or tending with
its <i>Bottom backwards</i>, may be pressed too much towards
the <span class='sc'>Spine</span>: So that its <i>Orifice</i> is not only raised <i>too high</i>
in the <span class='sc'>Belly</span>, but is also so <i>obliquely seated</i>, that it no
more answers to the <i>VAGINA</i> in a <i>right Line</i>, varying
more or less, according to the Proportion of this <i>Tendency</i>
to the <span class='sc'>Back-Bone</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> this <i>Posture</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> now, it necessarily
follows, that the <span class='sc'>Head</span> (tho’ never so well <i>turned</i>)
falls upon, and is violently forced against the <span class='sc'>Ossa
Pubis</span>; where the tender <span class='sc'>Head</span> sticking, often happens
by its own <i>Struggles</i> and the <i>Mother</i>’s <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAINS</em></i>, to be
grievously squeez’d and gradually crush’d, so that, until
it is removed and brought into the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PELVIS</em></i>, the
<i>Woman</i> can by no means bring forth her <i>INFANT</i>.
Wherefore the diligent and careful <i>MIDWIFE</i> must
(by due Attention) make it her Business to discern at
the <i>first</i> <span class='sc'>Touch</span> this <i>ill Position</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and presently
upon the <i>first Pang</i> of <span class='sc'>Labour</span>, try to help both
the <i>MOTHER</i> and the <i>CHILD</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREAS</em> otherwise the slothful and ignorant
<i>MIDWIFE</i>, may continue the poor <i>Woman</i> in an irregular
<span class='sc'>Labour</span> perhaps some Days, without perceiving
the <span class='sc'>Head</span> to be fixed upon <i>these Bones</i>, always erroneously
imagining the <i>INFANT</i> only to be situated <i>too
high</i>, (because it lies out of the reach of her <i>shallow</i>
<span class='sc'>Touch</span>) and that it must in due Time <i>fall down lower</i>
within her <i>Ken</i>. Or peradventure otherwise, when
by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, <i>she</i> feels a kind of <i>Roundness</i> or <i>Hardness</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>thro’ the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, mistaking <i>This</i> for the <span class='sc'>Head</span>,
<i>she</i> thinks the <i>INFANT</i> is well turned, and wants only
<i>strong PAINS</i> to drive it forwards with Success.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Ignorance</i> is chiefly owing to her own <i>Stupidity</i>,
in that <i>she</i> cannot clearly distinguish between the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> and the <span class='sc'>Vagina</span> by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>; nor the <i>Orifice</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> from the <i>Parts</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i>, or
<i><em class='gesperrt'>MEMBRANE</em></i>; which (in this <i>Case</i>) frequently occasions
the <i>Death</i> of many a <i>Dear <em class='gesperrt'>MOTHER</em></i> and
<i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> here it is to be moreover noted of this difficult
<i>Situation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, that the <i>MIDWIFE</i> (how
skilful soever) perhaps can either not <i>touch</i> the <span class='sc'>Orifice</span>
at all, or but very little, except it lies <i>wide open</i>, when
she may <i>touch</i> at least some Part of the <span class='sc'>Circle</span> of the
<i>Border</i>: For the <span class='sc'>Head</span> being fixed upon the <span class='sc'>Pubis</span>
above, the whole <i>upper Part</i> of the <i>Edges</i> of the <span class='sc'>Orifice</span>
can no ways peradventure be <i>touched</i> with the <i>Fingers</i>,
which may only reach the <i>lower Part</i> that is <i>Open</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> which, these <i>Fingers</i> are cautiously and
prudently to be thrust in farther betwixt the <i>Neck</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Bladder</span>, and the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>: Then being
so near the Neck of the Bladder, a discerning <i><em class='gesperrt'>MIDWIFE</em></i>
will feel a sort of a <i>Circular Border</i>, namely,
that of the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; which if she penetrates
with her <i>Fingers</i>, she will also find the hard Part
of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, which is <i>Smooth</i> and <i>Globular</i>, or the
opening of the <span class='sc'>Vertex</span>; whence she may be certain,
that the <i>INFANT</i>, as well as the <i>WOMB</i>, is too close
to the <span class='sc'>Spine</span> of the <i>Back</i>. Whereupon she ought,
without loss of Time, to assist and help the <i>CHILD</i>
in the following <i>Manner</i>; viz.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SHE</em> is to hinder the <i>Woman</i> from <i>labouring</i> all this
while, advising her to bear and put by her <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAINS</em></i>,
until this <i>Posture</i> of the <i>INFANT</i> can be duly corrected:
In order to which, I would <span class='sc'>First</span> order the
<i>Woman</i> to <i>make Water</i>, if she can, that the <span class='sc'>Bladder</span>
being thereby emptied, may not be hurt by the <i>Pressure</i>
of the <i>MIDWIFE</i>’s <i>Hand</i>, or the <i>CHILD</i>’s <i>Head</i>:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span><span class='sc'>Secondly</span>, if the <i>MEMBRANE</i> is not yet broken,
and the <span class='sc'>Pains</span> but <i>few</i> and <i>faint</i>, I would prescribe a
gentle <span class='sc'>Clyster</span>, not only to awaken <i>These</i>, but also
to remove all <i>Inconveniencies</i> of the <i>RECTUM</i>: <span class='sc'>Thirdly</span>,
I would then advise to lay the <i>Woman</i> in a convenient
manner, upon her <span class='sc'>Back</span> with the <i>superior</i> Part
of her Body lower than the <i>inferiour</i>, that both the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> and the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> may the more easily recede or
<i>give way back</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THEN</em> taking cautiously Hold of the <i>Border</i> of
the ORIFICE with the <i>Fingers</i> of <i>either Hand</i>, I would
press and draw it <i>back</i> towards the <i>RECTUM</i>, whilst
I employ’d my <i>other Hand</i> outwardly upon the <i>ABDOMEN</i>,
a little above the <i>OS PUBIS</i>: I mean, that
the <i>Child’s HEAD</i> ought to be <i>thrust back</i> a little
with the <i>Hand on the outside</i>, pressing it discreetly
<i>down</i>; as the <i>ORIFICE</i> is to be drawn <i>back</i> towards
the <i>RECTUM</i>, and at the same time also <i>downwards</i>,
with the <i>internal Hand</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the next Place, as I feel the <span class='sc'>Head</span> and the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> mov’d a little <i>downwards</i>, so I would also advise
the good <i>Woman</i> to raise the <i>upper Part</i> of her
Body, yet so as not to stir the <i>Lower</i>, and to <i>bend</i> herself
as much as possible <i>Forwards</i>, sitting as if she
was going to <i>Stool</i>: Because by this <i>Posture</i>, she raises
both the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> and the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> <i>behind</i>, and consequently
drives them <i>BOTH Forwards</i>, whilst I would
in the <i>Interim</i> keep my <i>HANDS</i> very fast placed as
aforesaid, ready to depress the <i>HEAD before</i>, that it
may fall directly into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>. In short, the <i>HEAD</i>
being thus disengag’d, I would now advise the <i>Woman</i>
to observe her <i>PAINS</i>, and mutually <i>labour</i> with them
what she can, with her Body mostly still in a <i>Sitting
Posture</i>, or kneeling with her <i>Arms</i> conveniently supported.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> supposing the <i>INFANT</i> to stick very fast
upon the <span class='sc'>Pubis</span> (which commonly happens by <i>Loss of
Time</i>, or by misimproving a critical <i>Minute</i>;) and that
the capable <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> finds both the <span class='sc'>Mother</span> and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span><span class='sc'>Child</span> in this miserable <i>Condition</i>, thro’ the Neglect
and Ignorance of <i>Another</i>: In this <i>Case</i> I would lay
the <i>Woman</i> altogether upon her <i>BACK</i>, with her
<i>HEAD low</i>, and her <i>BODY</i> a little <i>elevated</i>; then by
the abovesaid <i>Method</i> I would try to depress the <i>Infant’s
HEAD</i>, observing however yet not only to press it
<i>down</i> from <i>above</i>, but also first to <i>thrust it back</i>, and <i>depressing</i>
it at the same Time: By thus <i>repelling</i> it, I
would save the tender <i>HEAD</i> from being hurt by the
<i>Depression</i>; since otherways these <span class='sc'>Bones</span> would leave a
<i>Dent</i> or an <i>Impression</i> upon it, if not also wound it over
and above.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, supposing that the <i>MEMBRANE</i>
should break by Chance, and that by enlarging the
<i>Orifice</i>, the <i>HEAD</i> should be much <i>bared</i>: Then I would
let the <i>Border</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> alone, and endeavour to
thrust my <i>FINGERS</i> betwixt the <i>HEAD</i> (towards its
<i>Upper Part</i>) and the <i>OSSA PUBIS</i>; by which means
One may most probably draw the <i>HEAD downwards</i>,
along with the <i>Orifice</i>. However, in fine, this <i>Case</i>,
(as well as all other <i>preternatural BIRTHS</i>) absolutely
requires a sound <i>Judgment</i>, a quick <i>Comprehension</i>, a good
<i>Conduct</i>, an easy <i>soft Hand</i>, and a dextrous gentle <i>Method</i>
of treating the <i>parturient</i> and <i>patient WOMAN</i>.
But, farther——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WE</em> will again in the next Place <i>state</i> the <i>CASE</i>
thus, that suppose the <i>HEAD</i> is too Big, and the
<span class='sc'>Child</span> so much compressed, that it cannot be brought
into the <i>PELVIS</i> without great Trouble and Difficulty:
In this <i>Condition</i>, before <i>Matters</i> come to an
Extremity, I would (without Loss of Time) find out
the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>; in order to which, the <i>Orifice</i> (which is now
commonly less <i>open</i>) ought to be cautiously <i>open’d</i> with
a gentle <i>Force</i>, by thrusting first <i>one</i>, and then more
<span class='sc'>Fingers</span> <i>upwards</i>, which are to be gradually <i>distended</i>,
until at last the whole <i>HAND</i> is entered up to the
<i>Wrist</i>: Whereby (after prudently breaking the
<i>MEMBRANE</i>) I would now and then <i>thrust back</i> the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span><span class='sc'>Head</span>, and put it upon one <i>Side</i>, as much as possible by
<span class='sc'>Art</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> upon <i>This</i> here it must be carefully observ’d
by the way, that I would pass my <i>Hand</i> close
up along the <i>INFANT’s Body</i> from the <i>Orifice</i> to the
<i>Fund</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, or to the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>, that it may not
come between the <i>SECUNDINE</i> and the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, but
betwixt the <i>MEMBRANE</i> and the <i>CHILD</i>: By
this <i>Method</i> I shall neither hurt the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, nor the
<i>INFANT</i>; but the <i>HAND</i> distinguishing clearly all
the <i>Parts</i> of the <i>CHILD</i>, I cannot miss finding the
<i>Feet</i> with the greatest Certainty. Tho’ I must acknowledge
by the By, this to be the <i>Work</i> of a very
strong and agile <i>HAND</i>, as well as of a sound and
ready <i>Judgment</i>; because of the immense <i>Labour</i> and
Difficulty, first in opening the <i>narrow ORIFICE</i>, and
then in penetrating through it to the <i>Bottom</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, as the <i>INFANT</i> obstructs the Way: not to
mention the great <i>Inconveniencies</i> also besides, which
arise from the <i>Turnings</i> and <i>Windings</i>, as well as from
the <i>Length</i> and <i>Constriction</i> of the <i>Passage</i>. However
yet——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> having found <i>one</i> or <i>both FEET</i>, I would
draw them down <i>both together</i>, if possible, always turning
the <i>TOES</i> towards the <i>FACE</i>. Whereas if only
<i>ONE</i> can be found to be conveniently <i>attracted</i>, as it
often happens, I make it fast by a running <i>Knot on a
broad Ribband</i>, or by a certain <i>Bandage</i>, called <i>MITRA</i>,
or with a soft <i>Linnen Rag</i> about four Inches broad;
which I <i>twist</i> together, and hold in the <i>Hand without
the Body</i>, as I pass the <i>other</i> up along this <i>LEG</i>, duly
observing whether it is the <i>Right</i> or the <i>Left</i>, that I
may know which of my <i>HANDS</i> will most commodiously
find out the <i>other LEG</i>; and that <i>HAND</i> having
reached the <i>CHILD’s Belly</i> or <i>Buttocks</i>, I slide it
along the <i>THIGH</i> to the other <i>LEG</i>: So that the <i>FOOT</i>
being thus found, I bring it also down into the <i>PASSAGE</i>,
according to the <i>POSTURE</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span><em class='gesperrt'>BOTH</em> <i>FEET</i> being now thus <i>brought down</i>, if
they chance to be <i>ill-turned</i>, that is, with <i>TOES</i> up
and <i>HEELS downwards</i>, I discreetly <i>turn</i> the <i>CHILD</i>,
whilst I gradually draw forth the <i>FEET</i>. <i>These</i>, together
with the <i>BELLY</i>, being fairly excluded, I hold
the <i>FEET</i> with <i>one Hand</i>, whilst I put the <i>other</i> under
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BELLY</em></i> and <i><em class='gesperrt'>BREAST</em></i>, as far as possible: Or,
resting the <i>FEET</i> in my <i>Lap</i>, with <i>one Hand</i> above, and
<i>another</i> below, I take good hold of the <i>BODY</i>, attracting
it gently. Upon this I advise and encourage
my <i>Woman</i> now to <i>labour</i> her best, and that whether
she feels any <i>PAINS</i> or not, since they are now no
longer to be waited for with the Impatience of a happy
<i>Delivery</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BY</em> this regular <i>Method</i>, in fine, the <i><em class='gesperrt'>HEAD</em></i> and
<i>both <em class='gesperrt'>ARMS</em></i> pass thro’ the <i>Orifice</i> at once, and that
without the least <i>Danger</i>; because the <i>Smoothness</i> of the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>TEMPLES</em></i> affords always sufficient <i>Room</i> for the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>ARMS</em></i>, as the <i>Orifice</i> relaxes and dilates, as has been
already observed<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c017'><sup>[175]</sup></a>. Now <i>this</i>, in short, I take, with
Submission, to be the only genuine <i><em class='gesperrt'>METHOD</em></i> of
perfecting a successful <i>DELIVERY</i> in the present <i>preternatural
Condition</i>, whether the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i> be <i>Dead</i> or
<i>Alive</i>: So that hence I proceed in course to——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXI.</span><br /> <i>Of Præternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>, from the <em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em>’s inclining to either Side.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THO’</em> the <i>WOMB</i> may be <i>obliquated</i> (as has been
said) either to the <i>right</i> or <i>left Side</i>; yet, to abbreviate
this Work, I shall contract <i>both Situations</i> into
<i>one</i>; and because the ingenious <i>Reader</i> may easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>apply what is said of the <i>one</i> to the <i>other</i>, I shall only
treat of that inclining to the <i>right Side</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> most difficult <i>Posture</i> of this kind is, when
the <i>Bottom</i> of the <i>WOMB</i> is placed deeper in the <i>right
Side</i> towards the <span class='sc'>Loins</span>, tending more to the <i>Back</i> than
the <i>Forepart</i>. Which the <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> may know to distinguish
by the following <i>Signs</i>; namely, 1. By the
<i>Place</i> where the Woman feels the <i><em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em></i> move
most. 2. By that part of the <i>Belly</i> which is most
pointed and hard on the <i>Outside</i>. 3. By trying the
Woman in the beginning of the <i>Labour</i>, before the
<i>Pains</i> have moved the <i>WOMB</i> out of its Place, she
will find the <i>Orifice</i> of the <i>WOMB</i> suspended higher,
compressed to the <i>Spine</i> of the left <i>OS PUBIS</i> or <i>COXENDICIS</i>;
by which means the said <i>Orifice</i> cannot be
<i>touched</i> without Difficulty; and by no means the
<i>whole</i> of it, but only the <i>lower Border</i>. 4. She will
find the <i>INFANT’s Head</i> thro’ the <i>WOMB</i> and <i>VAGINA</i>
(tho’ not bare) laid <i>a-cross</i> the <i>PELVIS</i>, but
cannot come at the <i>lower Part</i> of it; only with one or
more <i>Fingers</i>, she may sometimes penetrate betwixt
the <i>Spine</i> of the said Bones, and touch the <i>VERTEX</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BY</em> these <i>Signs</i> the <i>MIDWIFE</i> soon finds her <i>Task</i>
most heavy and perplexed; for from thence proceeds
the following <i>Difficulties</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this <i>Posture</i> the <i>INFANT’s Head</i> (as soon as
it makes the lead <i>Apertion</i> of the <i>Orifice</i>) is fixed upon
the <i>Spine</i> of the left <i>OS PUBIS</i> or <i>COXENDICIS</i>; and
the <i>Head</i> thus fixed cannot pass forwards, because
those <i>Bones</i> cannot give way: From hence arise the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aquæ Furtivæ</span></i>, or a flowing of the <i>Waters</i> by Stealth, or
as it were, by <i>Distillation</i>; the <i>Orifice</i> as well as the <i>INFANT’s
Head</i> being shut up by the said <i>Bones</i>, so that
neither the <i>Head</i> nor the <i>Humours</i> can open it; save
only a little on the <i>lower Side</i>: Where the <i>Waters</i>, by
pressing the <i>Membranes</i> downwards in an <i>acute Form</i>,
break thro’ that <i>acuminated</i> Part as they also force
the <i>Head</i> upwards, near to the <i>Border</i> of the said
<span class='sc'>Bones</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>II. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> often happens, by these means, that the
<i>right Arm</i> is excluded, and falls down to the <i>Shoulder</i>
in the <i>PASSAGE</i>, the <i>INFANT</i> being left dry by the
unseasonable flowing of the <i>Waters</i>: And the <i>Arm</i> being
thus thrust forwards into the <i>PASSAGE</i>, the <i>Head</i>
is more and more forced-back <i>upwards</i>, so that the
<i>Neck</i> of Consequence is so bent, that it may easily
break; and the <i>Crown</i> of the <i>HEAD</i> (falling against
the <i>Spine</i> of the <i>PUBIS</i> or <i>COXENDICIS</i>) is so pressed
upon it by the violent <i>Pains</i>, that the <i>BRAIN</i> may be
readily affringed, and consequently the <i>INFANT</i> die
before <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> most deplorable <i>Condition</i> of all is when,
after all <i>Pains</i> and <i>Labours</i> suffered in vain, the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>
herself expires, without bringing forth her <i>Child</i>; as
it too often happens, that after a long continued and
miserable <i>Torment</i>, the <span class='sc'>Birth</span> is not a Jot advanced,
whereby of course the wretched <i>Woman</i> must undoubtedly
<i>yield up the Ghost</i> for want of effectual <i>Help</i>. I
say for want of <i>Help</i>, because the <i>Help</i> of such <span class='sc'>Midwives</span>
as are ignorant of the various <i>Postures</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and the <i>Method</i> of correcting them; and of
such as do not thorowly understand the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, but
place all their Hopes in <i>Nature</i> and <i>Divine Mercy</i>; is as
nothing, and of no Effect upon this <i>critical Occasion</i>:
Since the audacious <i>Ignorance</i> of such Creatures serves
only to tempt <span class='sc'>God</span> and his <i>Providence</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HAVING</em> thus defin’d and laid down the fatal
Inconveniences of this <i>Preternatural Situation</i>, I come
now to shew People concern’d how to correct it and
dispatch a happy <i>BIRTH</i>: In order to which, the
<i>præliminary Articles</i> are the <i>MIDWIFE’S</i> indefatigable
<i>Industry</i>, and accurate <i>Attention</i> to the Circumstances
of Things.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THEN</em> supposing an <i>INFANT</i> to be brought
forth <i>HEAD foremost</i>; the <i>Woman</i> is to be placed with
the upper part of her Body a little elevated, the
<i>MIDWIFE</i> then finding (by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>) the <i>Orifice</i>
to be but moderately press’d upon the <i>Left OS PUBIS</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>or <i>COXENDICIS</i>; in this <i>Case</i>, she is to be laid down
full upon the <i>right Side</i> a little obliquely, that the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> may fall back by its own Weight, and not relapse
against those <i>Bones</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NEXT</em> after this I would endeavour to get my
<i>right Hand-Fingers</i> above the upper Border of the <i>Orifice</i>,
and thereby remove it a little, and bring it down
nearer the <i>Cavity</i> of the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>. To facilitate which
<i>Work</i>, I would order some of the <i>By-Standing Women</i>
to raise her <i>right Side</i> a little, which of Consequence
raises the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> itself; and thus I would, by raising
and letting it down by Degrees, move it <i>forwards</i> into
the <i>PELVIS</i>: However, always taking special
Care, that the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, together with the <i>Head</i>, do
not slip down too far into the crooked <i>Sinus</i> of the
<i>OS SACRUM</i>, so as to stick there, (as has been already
precaution’d in the preceding <i>Chapter</i>:) to prevent
which unlucky <i>Accident</i>, I would advise to apply all
possible Care and Pains in the Beginning, to sustain
and keep up the <i>Orifice</i>, and to bare the <i>HEAD</i> sufficiently
before its Descent; observing also the same
Management in point of the <i>Humours</i>, until the <i>Membrane</i>
breaks; which being broken, I would treat the
<i>Head</i> in Manner as aforesaid.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> tho’ the <i>HEAD</i> in this <i>Posture</i> offers itself
as if it were <i>bent aside</i>, because of the <i>lateral Distorsion</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, I would first bring it to a right
<i>Position</i>, and then manage it as if it had presented
itself <i>directly</i>: And besides, the <i>HEAD</i> being thus
directed into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, I would always take care
that the <i>Woman’s Body</i> be bent a little towards the <i>left
Side</i>, that the <span class='sc'>Child</span> may the more readily be carried
down by its own <i>Weight</i> into the <i>PELVIS</i>. But, in
short, as to the farther Exclusion of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, and
<i>After-Birth</i>, as well as the <i>Cleansing</i> and <i>Contraction</i> of
the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; These Things are to be perform’d, as
directed by the foregoing <i>Chapter</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, we will now state the <i>Case</i>, and suppose
that the <i>Woman</i> is spent and tired out with
continual hard <i>Labour</i>, before the capable <i>MIDWIFE</i>
is sent for: Upon this <i>Condition</i> the <i>BIRTH</i> is to be
hastened by all possible prudent Means. In order to
which, I would (without Loss of Time) endeavour to
<i>turn</i> the <i>INFANT</i>, and extract it by the <i>Feet</i>; Because
to direct it otherways into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, would
be too tedious upon this Juncture. For to bring it
<i>Head foremost</i>, would create vehement <i>Pains</i>, which
infallibly would expose <i>both Lives</i> to extream Danger.
But now, in fine, having thus at large insisted upon
the various <i>Cases</i> of <i>Preternatural Births</i>, arising from
the four extream <i>oblique Situations</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; It
remains yet still, that I also subjoin a few Words,
upon such <i>Preternatural Cases</i>, as may proceed from
the less <i>oblique Positions of the same Body</i>; and that briefly
in manner following——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXII.</span><br /> <i>Of Præternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>, proceeding from the Median oblique Situations of the <em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> the three preceeding <i>Chapters</i> concern only
the Extremities of an <i>obliquated</i> <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, so they
necessarily lead me in this Place to offer a short <i>Hint</i>
Upon the <i>Median</i> or <i>Less oblique Uterine Positions</i>. Which
notwithstanding their great <i>Variety</i>, according to the
just Comparison formerly made<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c017'><sup>[176]</sup></a>, I shall for Brevity-sake
comprehend in <i>One</i>, and treat of in general
<i>Terms</i> as subsequently follows.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>I. <em class='gesperrt'>I</em> observe that however conspicuous and remarkable
the <i>Difference</i> of these <i>Preternatural Postures</i> may be,
especially <i>That</i> betwixt the <i>Four</i> mention’d <i>Extremes</i> and
the <i>Natural Situation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; yet I fear, that
there is too much Reason to suspect, that this <i>Difference</i>
is but little known to the generality of <i>Practitioners</i>
in <i>MIDWIFERY</i>, otherways I am sure <i>Patience</i>
would not be so much cry’d up, or at least <i>Time</i>
would not be so much trifled away, (at every difficult
<i><em class='gesperrt'>LABOUR</em></i>) by the <i>Ordinary Boethogynists</i>, neither
would the Use of <i>SHARPS</i> be so much practis’d by the
<i>Extraordinary MIDWIFE</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. I observe, that tho’ a <span class='sc'>Womb</span> <i>less oblique</i>, occasions
a <i>less Difficult</i>, or more easy <i>BIRTH</i>, than any
of the <i>Extremes</i>, yet the least Degree of an <i>oblique
uterine Posture</i>, may be of great Hindrance, and imminent
Danger to the <i>Woman</i>, whose attending
<i>MIDWIFE</i> is ignorant of it, as well as of the exact
<i>Method</i> of restoring it to its <i>Natural State</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>I</em> would observe by the way, that as the fatal
<i>Consequences</i> of such Ignorance, have already been sufficiently
precaution’d in the preceeding <i>Chapters</i>; so
it would be <i>supervacaneous</i>, and altogether needless to
re-assume or repeat them in <i>This</i>: Wherefore I shall
only farther, once for all, exhort and adjure such
<i>MIDWIVES</i>, as have any regard for their own <i>Consciences</i>,
and the <i>Lives</i> of their Neighbours, that they
would qualify themselves duly in these excellent Points
of Knowledge. And <i>This</i> I have the more Reason to
inculcate, because I never yet knew an assiduous <i>MIDWIFE</i>,
who was <i>thus perfectly</i> well endued with the
<i>essential Qualifications</i> of her <span class='sc'>Profession</span>, but the great
<i>GOD</i> rather (to whom the Glory of all Things is
due) perpetually compleated his own <i>Gifts</i>, and
crown’d the <i>Labour</i> of her Hands with desirable
<i>Success</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> as the <i>Husband-Man</i>, who never <i>sowed</i>, can
never expect to <i>reap</i>; or as the <i>Gardener</i>, who never
<i>planted</i>, can never hope to <i>gather</i>; so neither can the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span><i>MIDWIFE</i> who was never regularly qualified, ever
justly hope or expect to effect a happy <i>DELIVERY</i>;
especially not in <i>Cases</i> of Difficult and <i>Preternatural
BIRTHS</i>: Neither can the <i>Consequences</i> of her Mistakes
or Ignorance on the other Hand, ever detract from,
or lessen, the <i>Divine Power</i>, which is still the <span class='sc'>Same</span>,
and <i>can always do all Things that it will, but will not
always do all that it can</i>. Besides <i>HE</i>, who has been
pleased to lay such <i>Burthens</i> upon us, to try the <i>Patience</i>
and <i>Constancy</i> of <i>One</i>, and to exercise the <i>Industry</i>
and <i>Charity</i> of <i>another</i>; <i>HE</i>, I say, often executes his
<i>Judgments</i> upon <i>some</i>, for the <i>Sins</i> of <i>both Offenders</i>, that
all Things may the more manifestly tend to his own
eternal Glory.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. I come now in the <i>fourth</i> Place by certain <i>Demonstration</i>,
to explain the Nature of a <span class='sc'>Womb</span> less
<i>obliquated</i>, and to lay down the genuine Method of
correcting any <i>Preternatural Situation</i> whatsoever of the
disorder’d or distorted <span class='sc'>Womb</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> order to which, I would previously observe,
that all such <i>Postures</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, whether more or
less, either tending <i>aside</i>, or <i>prone</i>, or <i>supine</i>, are
only best discover’d by the <i>TOUCH</i>: Because the <i>Orifice</i>
always answering in a <i>strait Line</i> to the opposite
<i>Situation</i> of the <i>Bottom</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, can never fail to
shew its <i>Posture</i> to the judicious <i>MIDWIFE</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> if the <i>MIDWIFE</i> does but know exactly
the <i>Natural Position</i> of the <i>ORIFICE</i>, she may
thence easily conceive by how much it differs in an
<i>obliquated</i> <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and accordingly thereby readily
judge whereabouts the <i>Bottom</i> is seated: Which
<i>Situations</i> of <i>Bottom</i> and <i>Orifice</i> being known, she can
consequently be at no loss to comprehend the <i>Disposition</i>
of the whole <i>Uterine Body</i>. And if she now remembers
or recollects what has been said of <i>restoring</i>
and <i>replacing</i> the most <i>extream</i>, or most <i>oblique</i> <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
she will have no Difficulty in restoring any <span class='sc'>Womb</span> <i>less
oblique</i> to its <i>Natural Posture</i>; This depending entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>upon that Method, to which I refer<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c017'><sup>[177]</sup></a>, for Brevity’s
sake.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> short, I shall here only add, that if the <i>INFANT</i>
offers itself <i>well turn’d</i>, in this <i>less oblique</i>
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>; the <i>MIDWIFE</i>, having restored the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
to its right Place and natural <i>Posture</i>, will find nothing
more to do, but to take Care to facilitate and enlarge
the <i>Passage</i>, and receive the <i>CHILD</i> tenderly
with the <i>Head foremost</i>. Whereas in <i>Case</i> the <i>INFANT</i>
presents itself <i>ill-turn’d</i> in this <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, it is to be very
circumspectly extracted by the Feet; as by and by
will more amply appear from what ensues, <i>Viz.</i>——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXIII.</span><br /> <i>Of Preternatural BIRTHS, proceeding from complicated Causes, of both the INFANT and the WOMB.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>BY</em> this sort of <i>BIRTHS</i>, I mean such as are <i>Preternatural</i>,
both in respect of the <i>Situation</i> of the
<i>CHILD</i>, and of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>. Which complicated
<i>Preternatural BIRTH</i> is (of all <i>others</i>) the most dangerous;
because of an <i>Indefinity</i> of Accidents and
Difficulties with which it is always attended, according
to the many various <i>Postures</i> in which both the
<i>INFANT</i> and the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> are found: All which to enumerate
here, and to guard particularly against them,
as I have done in the preceeding <i>Cases</i>, would not
only augment the <i>Bulk</i> and <i>Charge</i> of this <i>WORK</i>,
but also be in some respect altogether <i>Needless</i>: Because
if I was to content my self to treat this <i>Chapter</i> in
<i>general</i> (without descending to <i>particular</i>) <i>TERMS</i>, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>would not doubt but that the ingenious <i>Reader</i>
would even thence readily form a clear <i>IDEA</i> of all
such <i>BIRTHS</i>, from the many different <i>Cases</i> already
stated and discussed; which if thoroughly well understood,
the Rest cannot but be easily comprehended.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, that I may not leave the weaker <i>Capacity</i>,
or the doubtful <i>MIDWIFE</i> to the Uncertainties
of her own scrupulous <i>Judgement</i>, I shall propose and
resolve some of the most difficult and dangerous <i>Cases</i>
belonging to this <i>preternatural Subject</i>, and <i>that</i> as far
as is really requisite, in manner following; <i>viz.</i>——</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>WE</em> Shall suppose that the <i>INFANT</i> is ill-turned,
and presents itself <i>preternaturally</i>, with <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Face</em></span>, <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Chin</em></span>,
<span class='sc'>Hand</span>, <span class='sc'>Elbow</span>, <span class='sc'>Shoulder</span>, <span class='sc'>Breast</span>, <span class='sc'>Back</span>, <span class='sc'>Belly</span>, <span class='sc'>Side</span>,
<span class='sc'>Buttock</span>, <span class='sc'>Knee</span>, <span class='sc'>Foot</span>, or any <i>other Part</i> or <i>Member</i>
first, in a <span class='sc'>Womb</span> tending <i>obliquely forwards</i>. In this
<i>Condition</i>, I shall <i>first</i> show the <i>MIDWIFE</i> how, and
by what <i>Signs</i>, she may know and discover such perverse
<i>Postures</i>; and <i>secondly</i> how, and by what Means,
<i>These</i> may be rectify’d, the <i>CHILD</i> extricated, and the
<i>MOTHER</i> reliev’d in Life.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THEN</em> as to the <i>First Point</i>, I would have it
minded, that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Touch</em></span> is the only <i>Expedient</i>, by
which the <i>Situation</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em></i> in any <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
whether <i>Oblique</i> or <i>Direct</i>, is to be discover’d and perfectly
known. Which when the <i>MIDWIFE</i> finds to
be <i>preternatural</i>, she needs not much trouble herself
about what <i>precise Part</i> offers or comes <i>first</i> in the
<i>PASSAGE</i>: Because of this short <i>Rule</i>, which I would
not have her to forget; namely, That, when the <span class='sc'>Head</span>
does not present itself <i>first</i> in this complicated <i>Case</i>, the
<i>CHILD</i> is to be drawn out by the <i>FEET</i>. For in this
ill <i>Position</i> of both the <i>INFANT</i> and the <i>WOMB</i>, the
<i>Version</i> of the <i>CHILD</i> succeeds more easily than if the
<span class='sc'>Head</span> was <i>foremost</i>: Wherefore I would lose no Time,
but as Soon as I had discover’d all <i>Circumstances</i> aright,
I would commence my Business upon this Occasion, before
either the <i>MOTHER</i> or the <i>INFANT</i> are much
spent, that I may perform my <i>Work</i>, while they both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>can mutually concur with me towards their own <i>Relief</i>;
That is, while the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> is yet suspended in the
<i>upper Part</i> of the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, and the <i>Membrane</i> not yet
broken.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> order to this <i>Second Point</i>, the <i>Woman</i> being
commodiously placed, the <i>MIDWIFE</i> is to pass up her
<i>Hand</i> into the <i>VAGINA</i>, and dispose the <i>Orifice</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span> to open, which is now sooner done than if the
<span class='sc'>Head</span> came <i>first</i>: <i>This</i> being done dextrously, she
is to put first <i>one</i> or <i>two Fingers</i>, then <i>all</i> of them
successively into the <i>Aperture</i>; and when that is sufficiently
enlarged, she is to penetrate into the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
and either break the <i>MEMBRANE</i>, or wait its <i>spontaneous
Breaking</i>, as she judges best by occurring <i>Circumstances</i>.
In the next place, she is to look for and find
the <i>FEET</i>; and, the <i>TOES</i> being always turn’d towards
the <span class='sc'>Rectum</span>, they are to be forthwith brought
into the <span class='sc'>Passage</span>: proceeding still farther in the due
and regular <i>Method</i> of extracting the <span class='sc'>Child</span>, as already
taught<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c017'><sup>[178]</sup></a> and dilucidated.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>WE</em> will suppose moreover, that the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> is
<i>ill-seated</i>, and presents itself <i>preternaturally</i> with any of
the aforementioned <i>Members first</i>, in a <span class='sc'>Womb</span> hanging
<i>obliquely to either Side</i>. In this <i>Case</i>, I would sincerely
advise the <i>MIDWIFE</i>, to lose no Time in opening the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, breaking the <span class='sc'>Membrane</span>, turning the <span class='sc'>Child</span>,
and extracting it by the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>: Because in this <i>Posture</i>
of both the <i>BIRTH</i> and the <i>WOMB</i>, Experience has
taught me that nothing can be safer and less dangerous
than this <i>Method</i>, when ingeniously and presently perform’d
with Dexterity.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is true indeed it may be <i>objected</i>, that I dissent
in <i>this Matter</i>, from most (if not from all) <i>Authors</i>: To
which I <i>answer</i>, in short, that <i>Those</i> from whom I do
differ, were never acquainted with this <i>complicated preternatural
Condition</i>, but always supposed the <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>
to continue in its proper Place, never dreaming of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>various <i>Motion</i>, nor suspecting its <i>oblique Situation</i>; erroneously
imagining all <i>preternatural BIRTHS</i> to proceed
merely from the ill <i>Version</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>: In
which <i>Circumstance</i> however, when it happens so, I confess
they are so far in the right, that the <span class='sc'>Head</span> is to be
<i>first</i> brought into the <span class='sc'>Passage</span>, and the <span class='sc'>Child</span> excluded
by it with all possible Expedition.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> that I may farther elucidate the true <i>State</i>
of this <i>Case</i>, as it becomes me to speak the <i>Truth</i> ingenuously,
it is my candid Opinion that, in any <i>oblique
Posture</i> of the <i>WOMB</i>, it is the safest, quickest, and
most convenient <i>Method</i> to extract the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> by the
<span class='sc'>Feet</span>, and that presently in the <i>Beginning</i> of the <span class='sc'>Labour</span>,
either before or at least presently after <span class='sc'>Flooding</span>,
as occasion requires. For this very Reason, and to this
Purpose, I hope, I may farther justly lay down <i>one certain
Rule</i>; namely, that all <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em> ill-turn’d</i>, in a
<i>WOMB ill-seated</i>, are to be rightly <i>turn’d</i> again, and
drawn out by the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>. Which <i>Rule</i>, if duly observed,
will, I am positive, save a World of <i>Women</i> and <i>Children</i>,
that otherwise must inevitably perish; since as for
my part, I know no <i>Situation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> in an <i>oblique
WOMB</i>, more difficult or dangerous than the <span class='sc'>Head</span>’s
<i>offering itself first</i>; and <i>that</i> because the <i>BIRTH</i> cannot
be then <i>turned</i> without the greatest <i>Difficulty</i> and most
extreme <i>Pains</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em>, in short, will be readily granted by All,
who do consider or conceive that the <i>WOMB</i> (being
fixed by <i>Ligaments</i> on both sides) is always more inclinable
to <i>fall Forwards</i> or <i>Backwards</i>, than to either <i>Side</i>,
and first most commonly <i>bends back</i> before it comes
to any <i>lateral Posture</i>; and that from hence of consequence,
the <i>WOMB</i> is <i>distorted</i> as well as <i>obliquely situated</i>.
By reason of which <i>Distortion</i>, if the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i>
comes <i>Head foremost</i>, it falls down in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pelvis</em></span>
<i>obliquely</i>; and tho’ a judicious <i>MIDWIFE</i> may bring
the <span class='sc'>Head</span> directly into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, yet the <i>Shoulders</i>
following, must needs fall upon the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span> <i>a-cross</i>, in
its narrower Part; whereby of reasonable Consequence
the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> must be distorted in the <i>Passage</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> in this <i>Case</i>, no <span class='sc'>Pains</span>, how violent soever,
can avail to force forwards the <i>BIRTH</i> so fixed upon
these <i>Bones</i>; wherefore (I say) when the <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i> is
thus <i>seated</i>, it is most safe in the <i>Beginning</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>LABOUR</em></i>,
to open its <i>Orifice</i>, break the <i>Membrane</i>, turn
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i>, and take it out by the <i>FEET</i>; since by
the <span class='sc'>Head</span>’s coming now <i>foremost</i>, both <i>Lives</i> are at Stake
and in great Jeopardy.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet it may be again <i>objected</i>, that
I have already prescribed another <i>Method</i> in <i>Chap.</i> 21;
<i>viz.</i> of bringing the <i>Orifice</i> together with the <span class='sc'>Head</span> into
the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, and promoting the <i>BIRTH</i> in that Manner:
To this I <i>answer</i>, that my <i>Reason</i> for so doing, was not
only to convince some People, that I know <i>their Method</i>
as well as <i>my own</i>; but also to whet or assist the
<i>Judgment</i> of such good <i>MIDWIVES</i> as cannot forsake
their own old <i>By-Paths</i>; Not that I ever design’d to
recommend <i>it</i> to any, tho’ I must however acknowledge,
that sometimes it may effect the desirable <i>Ends</i>; but
according to the <i>Rules</i> of irrefragable <i>Truth</i>, and sound
Judgment, we find that, in this <i>Position</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>,
let the <i>BIRTH</i> offer itself as it will, the only laudable
<i>Method</i> is without Loss of Time to extract the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>,
and deliver the <i>Woman</i> as above-directed.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. I observe upon the whole, that as the immediate
present <i>Case</i> is applicable to either (<i>right</i> or <i>left</i>) <i>Side</i>;
so what is said of the foregoing <i>Condition</i>, with respect
to the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>’s <i>inclining forwards</i>, may be easily apply’d
to the <i>Case</i> of its <i>tending backwards</i>: Only with this
considerable Difference, that the <i>oblique forward Posture</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, is the most commodious of the <i>Four</i>
mentioned <i>Extremes</i>, and consequently admits of a more
easy <i>Exclusion</i> of the <i>BIRTH</i> by the <i>Head</i>, than any of
the rest mentioned.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOT</em> but that either of these grand or complicated
<i>preternatural BIRTHS</i> imply and prognosticate imminent
Danger to the <i>MOTHER</i>, or the <i>CHILD</i>, or <i>Both</i>; as
well as incredible <i>Labour</i> and <i>Fatigue</i> to the faithful
<i>MIDWIFE</i>; who, in such <i>Cases</i>, can less distinctly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>feel, less commodiously handle, and more difficultly
come at the Matter, so as to dispose the <i>INFANT</i>’S
<i>Members</i> for <i>Attraction</i>, than in any other <i>Condition</i> of
<i>BIRTH</i>: Hence it is, in short, that so many <i>MIDWIVES</i>
are liable to the most egregious Mistakes, and
unaccountable Deceptions upon these unlucky Occasions.
But——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AGAIN</em> farther, I hope I may freely speak my
Mind, and openly avow, that the most of these <span class='sc'>Births</span>
proceed merely from want of seasonable and skilful
<i>Assistance</i> in the beginning of the <span class='sc'>Labour</span>: Because the
<i>BIRTH</i> (however well seated then) by reason of the <i>bad
Situation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, cannot possibly pass thro’ the
<span class='sc'>Pelvis</span> of itself; and not being judiciously assisted at
that nice Juncture, behold, from a <i>Natural</i>, it falls on
a sudden also into a <i>Preternatural Posture</i>. From
hence we have this extreme difficult and most dangerous
sort of <i>Preternatural BIRTHS</i>, as will more conspicuously
appear from a deliberate <i>Reflection</i> upon the preceding
<i>Chapters</i>. And This much (I hope) may finally
suffice any intelligent <i>Reader</i>, to conceive the different
<i>Circumstances</i> of all <i>complicated Preternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em></i>
whatsoever. Whence I go on to the <i>Fourth</i> and last
Sort of <i>Preternatural BIRTHS</i> proposed; namely, <i>Those</i>
proceeding from intervening <i>accidental Causes</i>; which
because they are also different, I shall handle briefly
and separately in the ensuing Manner; <i>viz.</i>——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXIV.</span><br /> <i>Of Preternatural BIRTHS, proceeding from the <em class='gesperrt'>NAVEL-STRING</em>’s coming first, and that either alone, or with some other Member.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>AMONG</em> the various unhappy <i>Accidents</i>, which
may happen in or about the Time of <span class='sc'>Labour</span>, the
present <i>Case</i> is none of the most auspicious; in as much
as it may, in sundry Respects, occasion a very difficult
<i>Preternatural BIRTH</i>, according to the Difference of
Circumstances: For the <span class='sc'>Navel-String</span> having fallen
down and come <i>first</i> in the <i>Passage</i>, may be variously
turn’d, and consequently cause several and sundry <i>Inconveniences</i>,
as follow, <i>viz.</i>——</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>WHEN</em> the <i>Umbilical Vessel</i> falls down alone into
the <span class='sc'>Passage</span>, without any other <i>Part</i>, the <i>BIRTH</i> is
then commonly situated a-cross in the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; and in
this <i>Condition</i>, <i><em class='gesperrt'>BACK</em></i> or <i>BELLY</i>, <i><em class='gesperrt'>HAND</em></i> or <i>FOOT</i>,
may be probably expected to come <i>first</i>: Wherefore the
active <i>MIDWIFE</i> ought to discover the <i>real Posture</i> by
the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, and <i>that</i> at least before all the <i>Waters</i> are
yet flow’d off and evacuated; and then betimes to
fetch away the <i>CHILD</i> by the <i>FEET</i>, unless the <span class='sc'>Head</span>
be more convenient or pat for the Purpose. But these
<i>Cases</i> being already particularly discussed<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c017'><sup>[179]</sup></a>, I shall add
nothing farther upon them in this Place.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>String</i> may fall down <i>double</i>, and so
swell with <i>Cold</i>, as to obstruct the <i>Passage</i>, which however
is but the smallest Consideration in this <i>Condition</i>,
because by its hanging down <i>double</i>, it may be so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>shortned, that the <i>CHILD</i> may be detain’d, appending
by it in the <i>Orifice</i>, until the <span class='sc'>Blood</span> of the <i>Umbilicals</i>
coagulating either by <i>Cold</i>, or by <i>Compression</i> in the
<i>Passage</i>, the due <i>Circulation</i> is obstructed, and the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>
expos’d to the greatest of <i>Dangers</i>, if a very speedy
<i>DELIVERY</i> does not prevent the fatal Accident.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> Prudent <i>MIDWIFE</i> ought always to be very
sollicitous about this <i>Case</i>, making it her particular <i>Care</i>
from the beginning of the <span class='sc'>Labour</span>, as soon as perceiv’d
by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>, and before the <i>Waters</i> break, to avert
or hinder its either coming <i>before</i>, or <i>along with the</i>
<span class='sc'>Head</span>, by removing it judiciously according to <i>Art</i>. But
supposing she comes too late to prevent the <i>Mischief</i>,
and that the <span class='sc'>String</span> is already in the <i>Passage</i>; then it is
to be <i>put back behind the</i> <span class='sc'>Head</span> immediately, and kept
there until the <span class='sc'>Head</span> be fully directed into and lodg’d
in the <i>Passage</i>. However it sometimes happens that it
cannot be kept-up so <i>long</i>, and that the <i>MIDWIFE</i>,
whatever <i>Pains</i> she may take, cannot hinder it from
extruding itself at every <span class='sc'>Pang</span>: In this <i>Condition</i>, I
would advise her (without delay) to extract the <span class='sc'>Birth</span>
by the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>, and that notwithstanding the <span class='sc'>Head</span> should
be <i>foremost</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> also happens sometimes, that the <span class='sc'>String</span>
without hanging down, is variously compress’d betwixt
the <span class='sc'>Head</span> and the <i>Bones</i> of the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, which (stopping
or impeding the <i>Motion</i> of the <span class='sc'>Blood</span>) soon occasions
the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>’s inevitable Death.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> which <i>Case</i>, if pressed against the <span class='sc'>Ossa Pubis</span>,
having laid the <i>Woman</i> on her <i>Back</i> with her <i>Head low</i>,
and the <i>lower Part of her Body raised</i>, I would press <i>back</i>
the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>’s <i>Head</i>, and put the <i>STRING</i> as much as
possible behind it; upon which, then I would bring
the <i>Head</i> forthwith into the <span class='sc'>Pelvis</span>, unless it be more
convenient to <i>turn</i> and <i>extract</i> it by the <i>FEET</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> also, tho’ seldom, it may happen, that the <i>Umbilical</i>
may be <i>pressed back</i> by the <span class='sc'>Head</span> against the <span class='sc'>Os
Sacrum</span>: In which State of Affairs, I would turn the
<i>Woman</i>, if Strength may permit, upon her <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Knees</em></span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>whilst I employ either <i>Hand</i> on the <i>Back Part</i>, in order
to remove the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, how firmly soever fixed: Whereas
if the <i>Patient</i> be weak, I would lay her upon either
<i>Side</i>, drawing up one <i>Foot</i> to her <i>Belly</i>, for the Advantage
of obtaining more Room, in order to effect the
same Thing; which, tho’ difficult, is no impossible
<i>Task</i> for the expert <i>MIDWIFE</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> if it chances to be pressed against either of
the <span class='sc'>Ossa Ilia</span>, having laid the <i>Woman</i> on the contrary
<i>Side</i>, with the <i>lower Part</i> of her Body elevated, I
would remove the <i>HEAD</i> with the opposite <i>Hand</i>, and
free the <i>STRING</i>; proceeding otherways as in the former
<i>Cases</i>, with <i>HEAD</i> or <i>FEET</i>, as I should find most
convenient.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>AGAIN</em>, it also sometimes comes to pass,
that the <i><em class='gesperrt'>STRING</em></i> is found lying upon the <i>Forehead</i>,
which is indeed most <i>dangerous</i>; but it is easily removed
with good Judgement to the <i>Temples</i> of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>,
which I take to be a safe <i>Position</i>, because there the
<i>Pressure</i> is much less aggravated.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em> it likewise sometimes happens,
that the <i>STRING</i> comes along with the <i>Shoulder</i>,
<i>Elbow</i>, <i>Hand</i>, <i>Foot</i>, &amp;c. without touching the <i>HEAD</i>:
Upon this then as soon as the <i>Humours</i> have flow’d, I
would pass my <i>Hand</i> quickly up, and bring the <i>CHILD</i>,
<i>Head</i> or <i>Feet foremost</i> into the <i>Passage</i>, according to its
<i>Situation</i>, always detaining or stopping the <i><em class='gesperrt'>STRING</em></i>
from coming out before the <i>BIRTH</i>: Whereas if the
<i>STRING</i> be already excluded along with the <i>Foot</i> or
the <i>Arm</i>, it is to be <i>repelled</i> with all necessary Speed,
Conduct, and Caution, and then the <i>INFANT</i> ought
to be dextrously drawn out by the <i>Feet</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. I have also seen the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i> brought forth
by the <i><em class='gesperrt'>HEAD</em></i>, with the <i>Umbilical</i> circumvolv’d,
or turn’d twice or thrice round the <i>NECK</i>; by which
means of the <i>STRING</i>’s being so much shortned, the
<i>BIRTH</i> was stopped or retained in the <i>Passage</i>: Upon
this Occasion, I endeavour’d to slacken the <i>STRING</i>,
and so bring it over the <i>HEAD</i>, but finding it too <i>strait</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>and <i>short</i> to be so ordered, I <i>tied</i> it in two places (at about
two or three <i>Inches</i> distance) and then <i>cut it in two</i> betwixt
the <i>Ligatures</i>: That being done, it was my Business to
lose no Time in attracting the <i>INFANT</i> and delivering
the <i>WOMAN</i>; otherways in this <i>Condition</i>, it would
have soon expired.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>ANOTHER</em> <i>Preternatural Accident</i> to which the
<i>BIRTH</i> is also sometimes liable, is the <i>Falling
down of the</i> <span class='sc'>Placenta</span> into the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>;
which of course must needs obstruct the <i>Passage</i>, and
prevent the timely <i>Egress</i> of the <i>INFANT</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> tho’ the ignorant <span class='sc'>Midwife</span> often occasions this
untoward <i>Accident</i> by her own unskilful and imprudent
<i>Treatment</i>, or rough and indecent <i>Usage</i>; yet the Ingenious
<i>MIDWIFE</i> discovers this <i>Case</i> in time by <i>two</i> certain
different <i>Ways</i>: Namely, <span class='sc'>First</span>, by the <span class='sc'>Touch</span>,
when she can neither feel the <i>MEMBRANE</i>, nor the
naked <i>HEAD</i>; but (on the contrary) perceives a thick,
soft, fleshy, boneless <i>Substance</i>: <span class='sc'>Secondly</span>, by a <i>Bloody
Flooding</i>, which constantly attends this <i>Condition</i>; whereby
both the <i>MOTHER</i> and the <i>CHILD</i> are imminently
endangered, as is already more abundantly set forth<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c017'><sup>[180]</sup></a>:
Unless the skilful <i>MIDWIFE</i> can prevent the fatal <i>Consequence</i>,
by accelerating the <i>BIRTH</i>; which, however
yet, is not to be rashly attempted without due Circumspection.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> notwithstanding the daring <i>Difficulties</i>, and
time-serving <i>Precautions</i>, mentioned by most <i>Authors</i> of
my reading and revolving, in this <i>Case</i>; I can conceive
no extraordinary <i>Perplexity</i> which can attend it, if the
<i>DELIVERY</i> be but <i>timely</i> or <i>seasonably</i> undertaken, before
the <i>Woman’s Strength</i> and <i>Blood</i> be too much exhausted.
I know <i>Daventer</i>, <i>Peu</i>, and some <i>others</i>, make
long <i>Ambages</i> or Circumlocutions upon this <i>Head</i>; for
<i>some</i> are at great Pains to teach us how to perforate the
<i>SECUNDINE</i> with a <i>Hair-Needle</i> instead of our <i>Fingers</i>,
and <i>others</i> how to keep it back, until the <i>INFANT</i>
be first born: But for my part, as I already foresee sundry
<i>Difficulties</i> that will arise in these Practices, so I
shall be loth to come into them, and that because——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em>, in penetrating the <span class='sc'>Placenta</span> with any
<i>acute Instrument</i>, the <i>CHILD</i> (if not the <i>MOTHER</i> also)
may be easily wounded: <span class='sc'>Secondly</span>, supposing it
to be done with the <span class='sc'>Fingers</span>, the <i>Hole</i> must be dilated
in proportion to the <i>Aperture</i> of the Mouth of the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, and then <i>this</i> mangled <span class='sc'>Mass</span> must be dispersed
to <i>all Sides</i> of the <i>Orifice</i>; by which Means, <i>Daventer</i>
himself acknowledges, that it often perfectly <i>congeals</i>
with <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, and sticks so fast to the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> or <span class='sc'>Vagina</span>,
that the <i>Ignorant</i> would not only take them to be
<i>grown together</i>, but also believe them rather to be <i>one and
the same Body</i>: Which consequently must require both
great <i>Pains</i> and <i>Difficulty</i> to be separated, and at last a
very diligent <i>Scrutiny</i> must be made, that no <i>Fragment</i>
be left any where <i>Behind</i>, since in this <i>Condition</i> no just
<i>Conjecture</i> can be made by the Eye: <span class='sc'>Thirdly</span>, by retaining
the <i>SECUNDINE</i> in the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, when its heaviest
and most bulky <i>Part</i> (the <span class='sc'>Placenta</span>) is fallen
down into the <i>Entrance</i>, let it be never so judiciously
managed and moved, it possesses a considerable deal of
<i>Room</i>, and consequently obstructs the <i>Operation</i> of the
<i>MIDWIFE</i>’s <i>Hand</i>, lying as a cross thwarting <i>Impediment</i>
in her way, which at the same Time <i>blockades</i> or
totally shuts up the <i>Passage</i> of the <i>CHILD</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em>, and considering that this <i>Body</i>,
when so loosened and separated from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, can
never possibly be any more <i>serviceable</i>; but, on the contrary,
highly <i>detrimental</i> to both the <i>MOTHER</i> and the
<i>INFANT</i>, as aforesaid; I cannot but be of Opinion,
that it is both the safest and shortest Way, to extract
the <i>SECUNDINE first</i>; by which expeditious <i>Step</i>, the
<i>MIDWIFE</i> not only gains more <i>Room</i> to turn the <span class='sc'>Child</span>,
but also (this being done) she can much more commodiously
draw it out by the <span class='sc'>Heels</span>: Animadverting
always by the way, that in this critical <i>Condition</i>, the
<i>BIRTH</i> must immediately follow the <i>SECUNDINE</i>,
without the Loss of one Moment’s Time, and <i>that</i>
especially for stopping the <i>Floodings</i>, which would otherways
not only soon suffocate the weak <span class='sc'>Infant</span>, but also
in a short Space of Time effect the certain <i>Death</i> of the
tender <span class='sc'>Mother</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XXVI.</span><br /> <i>Of Preternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em>, proceeding from the Death of the <em class='gesperrt'>INFANT</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>AMONG</em> the many <i>Preternatural BIRTHS</i> mentioned,
I think <i>that</i> of a <i>Dead CHILD</i>, may now
at last justly take place.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> because this <i>Case</i> is too commonly mistaken,
and that the <i>Live INFANT</i> is too often taken for
<i>Dead</i>, and consequently the wretched innocent <i>Creature</i>
treated accordingly; I think it may not be amiss, before
I enter upon this <span class='sc'>Delivery</span>, that I make a few
previous requisite <i>Remarks</i>; by which the extraordinary
<i>MIDWIFE</i>, who is commonly sent for too late,
may perfectly know whether the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i> be <i>dead</i> or
<i>alive</i>; to the End that, so also in Case of <i>Necessity</i>, it
may be accordingly managed: Since in this fatal <i>Condition</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>I have known <i>several Persons</i> to have been grossly
deceiv’d, who have depended upon the <i>Relation</i> of the
sick <span class='sc'>Woman</span>, or taken it upon the <i>Credit</i> of the ignorant
attending <i>MIDWIFE</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em> then I know it to be <span class='sc'>Alive</span>, if, by laying
my <i>Hand</i> on the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>’s <i>Belly</i>, I find it <i>stir</i> or <i>move</i>:
Or, <span class='sc'>Secondly</span>, If I have not full <i>Satisfaction</i> this way,
I would convey my <i>Hand</i> into the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, as soon as the
<i>Waters</i> break, to feel the <i>Pulsation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Navel-String</span>;
which the nearer I feel to the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em></i>’s <i>Belly</i>, the
stronger I find it <i>beat</i>, if <span class='sc'>Alive</span>: Or, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Thirdly</span></em>, I
would put my <i>Finger</i> into the <i>INFANT</i>’s <i>Mouth</i> to feel
its <i>Tongue</i>, which (if <span class='sc'>Alive</span>) I should perceive it to <i>stir</i>,
as if it would <i>suck</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREAS</em>, on the contrary, we may know it to
be <span class='sc'>Dead</span>, when a certain nauseous and cadaverous <i>Humour</i>
flows from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>: Or, when the <i>Woman</i> feels
a great ponderous <i>Weight</i> in her <i>BELLY</i>, tumbling always
towards that <i>Side</i>, which she inclines to, or lies
upon: As also when we find the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em> cold</i> in the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>; or the <i>Umbilical</i> Vessel without <span class='sc'>Pulse</span>; or the
<span class='sc'>Tongue</span> <i>immoveable</i>: Or lastly, when I perceive the <i>Dissolution
of the Cuticle</i> on the Top of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>, I am
then positive that the <span class='sc'>Foetus</span> is <span class='sc'>Dead</span>; because, as
<i>this</i> is not easily <i>dissolved</i>, neither does it happen immediately,
but some Space of time after <span class='sc'>Death</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this <i>Case</i> then of a <i>dead CHILD</i>, the <i>Labour</i> is
commonly lingring and dangerous, because of the few,
faint, and slow <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAINS</em></i> which seize the <i>Woman</i>; so
that <i>Nature</i>, being half overthrown by the <i>Death</i> of the
<i>INFANT</i>, which now can no ways help itself, absolutely
requires to be assisted by the most expeditious
<span class='sc'>Art</span>: And <i>that</i> best, in my humble Opinion, by the
<i>Means</i> and <i>Method</i> following, <i>viz.</i>——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em> I would endeavour to awaken and promote
the <i>PAINS</i>, by one or more sharp and strong <i>Clysters</i>:
But <span class='sc'>Secondly</span>, if <i>these</i> do not succeed so expeditiously
as necessary, I would introduce my <i>Hand</i> into the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, sliding it all along under the <span class='sc'>Belly</span> towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>the <span class='sc'>Feet</span>; and so, with <i>Face</i> and <i>Breast</i> downwards, I
would gently extract it by them; in the same manner,
as if it was <span class='sc'>Alive</span>. Only, in this <i>Case</i>, great <i>Care</i>
must be taken, that the <span class='sc'>Head</span> may not unhappily <i>sever</i>
itself from the <i>Body</i>, and consequently <i>stay behind</i> in
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; which Accident may easily happen in
the <i>Passage</i>, especially if the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i> is any ways
<i>putrefy’d</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, after all, in <i>Case</i> of such an untoward
<i>Occurrence</i>, I would still excuse myself from the
<i>Use</i> of an <span class='sc'>Eductor</span>, and debar myself from the Practice
of any <i>Instrument</i> whatsoever, save only that of my own
natural <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hand</em></span>; which, I think, in all <i>Conditions</i> of
<i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em></i>, whether <i>Natural</i> or <i>Preternatural</i>, <i>Dead</i> or
<i>Alive</i>, is solely <i>obliged</i>, and only best serves, according to
the <i>Rules</i> of my <i>Profession</i>, to discharge the <i>Duty</i> of
all the <i>INSTRUMENTS</i> in the <i>Surgeon’s Shop</i>; excepting
only in the <i>Case</i> of a <i>MONSTER</i> or a very <i>Hydropical
CHILD</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in the present <i>Circumstance</i> of the <span class='sc'>Head</span>’s being
separated from the <i>Body</i>, as soon as I have extracted
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CARCASE</em></i>, as above; I would instantly
convey back my <i>Hand</i> into the <i>WOMB</i>, and put one
or two of its <i>Fingers</i> into the <i>Mouth</i> of the <i>HEAD</i>,
placing my <i>Thumb</i> under the <i>Chin</i>: For by <i>thus</i> taking
Hold of it by the <i>Jaw</i>, I would extract it gently, and
<i>that</i> with the greatest <i>Ease</i> and <i>Safety</i> to the <i>PATIENT
Woman</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> having thus, in fine, both particularly and
at large, treated of the several <i>Sorts</i> of <i>Natural</i>, <i>Difficult</i>,
and <i>Preternatural BIRTHS</i>: And having also for
the common <i>Good of Mankind</i>, without any Affectation,
Hesitation, or Reservation, candidly laid down, and
ingenuously set forth the most <i>certain</i>, <i>brief</i>, <i>plain</i>, <i>easy</i>,
and <i>unprejudiced INSTRUCTIONS</i>, which perhaps have
ever yet been committed to <span class='sc'>Print</span>, upon the excellent
<i>Subject</i> of <i>MIDWIFERY</i>: And having likewise, in a
Word <i>lastly</i>, for the true <i>Direction</i> and good <i>Government</i>
of all <i>MIDWIVES</i>, fairly laid (as it were) and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>faithfully <i>delivered</i> the <i>big-belly’d Woman</i>, in every relative
<i>Case</i> or <i>Condition</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>, which may or
can happen to her: It now only remains, I would
modestly think, that I should (in the next place)
come to take all the necessary <i>Care</i>, and make the
most requisite <i>Provision</i> possible for the perfect <i>Recovery</i>
of my <span class='sc'>Child-Bed-Woman</span>; and <i>that</i> in the ensuing
<i>Method</i>.</p>

<em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Good Woman</i> being now delivered,
and laid in <span class='sc'>Child-Bed</span>, may rightly be
compared to a <span class='sc'>Ship</span>, which, after a dangerous
nine or ten Months <i>Voyage</i>, rides
at <i>Anchor</i> in her <span class='sc'>Port</span>; where, tho’ arriv’d
with great Security, yet if not well
<i>moor’d</i> against sudden <i>Winds</i> and <i>Storms</i>, she may perhaps
at last drive from her <i>Anchors</i> and suffer <span class='sc'>Shipwreck</span>: So
in like manner if both the <span class='sc'>Mother</span> and the <span class='sc'>Child</span> be
not duly taken <i>Care</i> of after the <i>BIRTH</i>, <i>Both</i> may be
still expos’d to the Danger of <i>DEATH</i>. Wherefore,
to prevent all such melancholy <i>Accidents</i>, I shall first
point out the proper <i>REGIMEN</i> of the <i>One</i>, and then
successively direct <span class='sc'>That</span> of the <i>Other</i>, in the following
Manner; <i>viz.</i>——</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THEN</em>, immediately after the <i>BIRTH</i>, a soft
gentle <i>Closure</i> may be apply’d to the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> for repelling
of the <i>cold Air</i>; of which we must be now very cautious,
if we will <i>avert</i> the fatal <i>Consequences</i> that may
thereby happen: As also a small <i>Plaister</i> of <span class='sc'>Galbanum</span>
with a little <i>Civet</i> in its Center, may be applied to the
<i>NAVEL</i> for attracting, or rather retaining the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>
in its proper Place, where the <i>MIDWIFE</i>’s careful
<i>Hand</i> has fixed it after the <i>DELIVERY</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Patient</i> having her <i>Body</i> wrap’d about
with a <i>warm Cloth</i>, and her <i>Hips</i> girt round with the
same, is to be placed conveniently in a <i>warm</i> <span class='sc'>Bed</span>;
that is, directly upon her <i>Back-Bone</i>, with her <i>Head</i>
and <i>Body</i> a little elevated, for her <i>breathing</i> and <i>cleansing</i>
the Better; as her <i>Thighs</i> and <i>Legs</i> also are to be
stretched down close together: Whereupon <i>now</i>, if not
<i>before</i>, she ought to have a little good <i>Chicken</i> or <i>Pullet-Broth</i>
for her Refreshment; which being done, all
<i>Doors</i> and <i>Windows</i> are to be shut, and the <i>Bed-Curtains</i>
drawn close, that she may rest and sleep quietly.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the next place, the <i>Closures</i> are to be remov’d,
and the <i>clotted</i> <span class='sc'>Blood</span> taken away; which being
diligently done, the <i>BELLY</i>, <i>LOINS</i>, and <i>PRIVITIES</i>
are to be anointed with the Oil of <i>sweet Almonds</i>,
or <i>white Lillies</i>, mixed with a little warm <i>Wine</i>, which
may be repeated at pleasure, for allaying the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAINS</em></i> of
these <i>Parts</i>: And as the <i>Woman</i> is to be carefully kept
always very <i>warm</i>, as well as disposed to <i>Rest</i> and
<i>Sleep</i>; so every now and then, she is to be comforted
with some small Matter of any convenient <span class='sc'>Food</span>; abstaining
however chiefly from <i>strong Meats</i>, as well as
from all <i>hot</i> or <i>strong Liquors</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. A <span class='sc'>Decoction</span> of <i>Barley</i>, <i>Linseed</i>, and <i>Chervil</i>, or
<i>Marsh-Mallows</i> and <i>Violet-Leaves</i>, with a little Honey of
<i>Roses</i>, may be afterwards used <i>Milk-warm</i> three or four
times a Day, by way of <i>Fomentation</i> for the first five or
six Days of <i>CHILD-BED</i>: Or, instead of these Things,
fresh <i>warm Milk</i>, or <i>Barley-Water</i> only may be properly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>used; always remembring that the <i>Parts</i> be duly
cleansed from the <i>clotted</i> <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the mean time, the <i>Woman’s</i> <span class='sc'>Breasts</span> are
all along to be kept very close and warm-cover’d with
soft <i>Cloaths</i>, that the <i>MILK</i> may not <i>curdle</i>; which
however is no ways yet in the beginning fit for the
<i>CHILD’s Nourishment</i>, until the <i>Conflux</i> of the <i>MILK</i>
and the <i>Humours</i> is over; which, upon the first days
after <i><em class='gesperrt'>DELIVERY</em></i>, run in abundance to the
<span class='sc'>Breasts</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>SPECIAL</em> Care also must be taken, when the
<i>Woman</i> is resolv’d not to <i>Nurse</i> the <i>CHILD</i> herself, that
the <span class='sc'>Lochia</span> or <i>Child-Bed-Evacuations</i> flow-off plentifully,
in order that thereby the <i>Shock</i> of the <i>BLOOD</i>
may be averted from the <i>BREASTS</i>; which if not
sufficient to prevent that <i>Inconveniency</i>, they may be
properly anointed with the Oil of <i>ROSES</i> and a
little <i>Vinegar</i> beat-up together; or a <i>CATAPLASM</i> of
the Meal of <i>Beans</i> and <i>Vetches</i> mixed with <i>Oxymel</i>
may be applied to the <i>BREASTS</i>; or they may be
fomented with a <i>Decoction</i> of the Leaves of <i>Mint</i>, <i>Dill</i>,
or <i>Parsley</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. <em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the time of <i>Cleansing</i>, all Noise and Clamour
about the <i>Woman</i> ought to be suppressed; and
as she herself ought not to talk much, or <i>aloud</i>,
neither ought any Person about her to be <i>obstreperous</i>:
Because her <i>Repose</i> is not only thereby disturb’d, but
also her <i>Spirits</i> exagitated; which violent Commotion
of <i>Humours</i> may readily stop the <i>natural Course</i>. And as
for the same Reason, all <i>Passions</i> of the Mind are to be
suppressed; so the <i>Woman</i> is to keep herself as much
as she conveniently can upon her <i>Back</i>, carefully avoiding
frequent <i>TURNINGS</i> to either Side.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. <em class='gesperrt'>AFTER</em> ten or twelve Days, proper Measures
may be taken to fortify and strengthen the <i>Members</i>;
and after she has fully done cleansing (which may
be about the 20th <i>Day</i>, sooner or later after <i>DELIVERY</i>,
according to the <span class='sc'>Patient</span>’s <i>Constitution</i>, or her
way of <i>Living</i>) some proper <i>Astringent Medicines</i> may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>be discreetly made use of, for corroborating and reconsolidating
the <i>Parts</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IX. <em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to her <i>DIET</i>, during this Time, she
ought to be very regular, and live <i>abstemiously</i> (especially
the <i>first Days</i>) as if she had a <span class='sc'>Fever</span>, using only
good <i>Broths</i>, <i>Jellies</i>, fresh-laid <i>Eggs</i>, <i>Ale-soup</i> made
with fresh <i>Butter</i>, or the like; after which, she may
begin by degrees to eat a little <i>Chicken</i>, <i>Pullet</i>, <i>Capon</i>,
<i>Veal</i>, <i>Mutton</i>, or any thing else of good <i>Nutrition</i> and
easy <i>Concoction</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to her <i>DRINK</i>, if she has no <i>Fever</i>, she may
use besides her <i>Cawdles</i>, small <i>White-Wine</i> and <i>Water</i>
for Variety’s sake; but in case of a <i>Fever</i>, Water
boil’d with a little <i>Cinnamon</i>, or <i>Coriander-Seed</i>; or a <i>Ptisan</i>
of <i>Liquorish</i>, <i>Figs</i>, and <i>Aniseeds</i> boil’d in Water; or
<i>small Ale</i> a little butter’d, as the <i>Woman</i> pleases, are far
more convenient; observing always carefully that her
<i>DRINK</i>, of whatsoever sort, be at all times a little
<i>warmed</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>X. <em class='gesperrt'>FINALLY</em>, as the <i>Child-Bed-Woman</i>’s Body
is always to be kept open, if not otherways naturally
so, by a proper gentle <i>CLYSTER</i>, repeated as often as
Necessity requires, until the <i>Course</i> of the <span class='sc'>Lochia</span>
is quite over; so afterwards she ought to take one or
more proper gentle <span class='sc'>Purges</span>, for cleansing the <i>Stomach</i> and
the <i>Bowels</i> of such vitious <i>Humours</i>, as <i>Nature</i> could
not otherways evacuate: Upon which, a repeated
Strengthening <i>BATH</i> may be most pertinently used, as
also, in order that she may again the more successfully
<i>begin upon a new Score</i>, other proper Measures may be
prudently taken.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> we suppose that all things have succeeded
well with our <i>Puerperial Woman</i>; in which
Condition the above-mention’d is her only requisite
<i>REGIMEN</i>: But in Case of any <i>Preternatural Accident</i>,
we must come to her <i>Assistance</i>, according as the
Nature of <i>Circumstances</i> does require: Of all which in
their Order, as they most commonly happen to the
<i>Woman</i> in her present <i>Condition</i>; and FIRST——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> II.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>AFTER-PAINS</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> <span class='sc'>Pains</span>, which usually accompany or follow
after the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>, are common to all
<i>Child-Bed-Women</i>; and in that <i>Natural Sense</i>, as they
proceed only from the quantity of <i>BLOOD</i> abounding
in the relaxed Womb, distending its <i>MEMBRANES</i>,
or arise from its <i>Acrimony</i>; so they gradually
cease, and in two or three days quite vanish:
Wherefore I am not to insist upon <i>Those</i>, which only
affect the debilitated <span class='sc'>Womb</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> it often and too commonly also happens, that
another Sort, justly call’d <i>Preternatural AFTER-PAINS</i>,
afflict the <i>Woman</i>; which she sometimes feels
about her <i>Loins</i> and her <i>Groins</i>, sometimes about the
<i>Navel</i>, sometimes all over the <i>Belly</i>, and sometimes
in the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> only, and that sometimes with a little,
and sometimes without any <i>Intermission</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> most common <i>Cause</i> of which <i>PAINS</i> is generally
one of the <i>Five</i> following; <i>Viz.</i> 1. The <i>External
AIR</i>, especially the more <i>frigid</i>, which easily penetrates
into the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, if not carefully prevented:
2. <i>Clotted BLOOD</i>, or some other <i>foreign Body</i> left behind
in the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>: 3. Some <i>Acrid</i>, and <i>Mordacious</i>
<span class='sc'>Blood</span> adhering to the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, which excites and
stimulates <i>Excretion</i>: 4. The <i>SERUM</i> vellicating or
twitching the <i>excoriated</i> part of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>: Or,
5. <i>WINDS</i> elevated from the <i>Humours</i> fermenting in
its <i>Substance</i>; which, together with those turgent <i>Humours</i>,
tear its tender <i>TUNICKS</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> because these <span class='sc'>Pains</span> often excruciate the
<i>Woman</i> as much as the <i>real</i> <span class='sc'>Labour-Pains</span> do, and
since they are not always without <i>Danger</i>, Necessity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>demands that they should be either <i>cured</i>, or at least
<i>mitigated</i>: Which may be most properly done, by
convenient relaxing and attenuating <i>Medicines</i> outwardly
applied, as well as inwardly taken, when the <i>Case</i>
does not require the <i>Hand-Cure</i>, or manual Operation.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, yet more particularly, in respect of
the <span class='sc'>Pains</span>, from what <i>Cause</i> soever they may proceed,
<i>CLYSTERS</i> of <i>Milk</i> with the <i>Yolks of Eggs</i> are
proper; as are also emollient <i>Fomentations</i> mix’d with
attenuating and <i>Uterine Medicines</i>; a <i>Fumigation</i> of
<i>BRANDY</i>; a <i>Decoction</i> of the <i>Recrements</i> of the <i>Regulus</i>
of <i>Antimony</i>; such things being of a <i>sulphurous
Nature</i>: And moreover, in fine, all <i>AFTER-PAINS</i>
are eased by <i>Aromatick</i> and <i>Carminative Remedies</i>;
such as Seeds of <i>Anise</i>, <i>Carway</i>, <i>Cummin</i>, <i>Fennel</i>,
<i>Penny-Royal</i>, <i>Roman-Camomil</i>, &amp;c. infus’d or boil’d in
<i>Wine</i> or <i>Water</i>, adding thereto a very little <i>Mace</i> and
<i>Saffron</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> III.</span><br /> <i>Of the Suppression of the LOCHIA, or Child-Bed-Purgations.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>LOCHIA</i> are nothing else, but the ignobler
part of the <i>Blood</i> and congested <i>Humours</i>, which
after the <i>BIRTH Nature</i> evacuates and discharges out
of the <i>Uterine Vessels</i>, in consequence of the <i>Divulsion</i>
and <i>Separation</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Placenta</em></span> from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>.
Which <i>LOCHIA</i> however differ always according to
the Constitution and Disposition of the <i>Woman</i>, and
that not only in <i>Quantity</i>, but also in <i>Quality</i>: For
if the <i>PATIENT</i> be otherways Healthy, and Well-disposed,
<i>these</i> are at first of a <i>florid rosy Colour</i>, degenerating
day by day into a <i>Pale-dye</i>; Whereas if otherways,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>they are sometimes <i>Aqueous</i>, and sometimes <i>Bilous</i>,
<i>Melancholick</i>, &amp;c. And, according also to the usual
<i>Habit</i> of Body, and <i>Way of Living</i>, <i>some</i> Women <i>flood</i>
more plentifully, <i>others</i> more sparingly; <i>some</i> a longer,
and <i>others</i> a shorter Time: as for Instance——</p>

<p class='c005'>A <i>Woman</i> given to <i>Ease</i>, and <i>high Living</i>, being delivered
of a <span class='sc'>Male</span>, may <i>cleanse</i> from twenty to thirty
Days; and if of a <span class='sc'>Female</span>, from thirty to forty-two
Days at most, however still declining in <i>Quantity</i> from
Day to Day: Whereas <i>another</i> given to <i>Exercise</i>, may
<i>flood</i> only from eight to fifteen Days; and <i>that</i> also perhaps
more <i>sparingly</i>, or by <i>Intervals</i> of one or two Days.
But it oftentimes happens, that this <i>Evacuation</i> is either
suppressed in Whole, or in Part; of which <i>Suppression</i>
or <i>Preternatural Retention</i>, I am now about to speak.——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em> then, the <i>Cause</i> of this <span class='sc'>Evil</span>, proceeds either
from an <i>Obstruction</i> of the <i>Uterine Vessels</i>, occasion’d by
<i>thick BLOOD</i> stopping the <i>Passages</i>: Or, <span class='sc'>Secondly</span>,
from a <i>Constriction</i> or <i>Compression</i> of the same <i>Vessels</i>, occasioned
by an <i>oblique Situation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>, or by
cold <i>Air</i>, cold <i>Drink</i>, or the like, which readily constrict
their <i>Orifices</i>, as well as contract the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> itself:
Or, <span class='sc'>Thirdly</span> and lastly, the <i>Cause</i> may proceed
from the <i>BLOOD</i>’s being retracted and converted to
some <i>other Part</i> of the Body; which is most commonly
occasion’d by some <i>Passion</i> or <i>Perturbation</i> of Mind, that
may not only turn the <i>Shock</i> of the <i>BLOOD</i> to the
<span class='sc'>Breasts</span>, but also retard the <i>Motion</i>, and thicken the
<span class='sc'>Mass</span> of the same <i>BLOOD</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i><em class='gesperrt'>DIAGNOSTICKS</em></i> however of this
<i>Distemper</i> are manifest; for either no <i>BLOOD</i> is voided
at all, or too small a <i>Quantity</i>, in respect to the <i>Size</i>,
<i>Temperament</i>, and <i>Constitution</i> of the <i>PATIENT</i>: But
besides, it may be also known by the following
<i>Symptoms</i>; viz. a <i>SWELLING</i> of the <i>BELLY</i>, upon the
Retention of the <i>Humours</i> that ought to be evacuated;
a <i>Difficulty of Breathing</i> arises; <span class='sc'>Pains</span> seize the <i>Abdomen</i>,
as also the <i>Loins</i> and the <i>Groins</i>; a <i>Fever</i> and <i>Tremblings</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>follow; as <i>Faintings</i> do upon a weak, quick and
unequal <i>Pulse</i>; something <i>fuliginous</i> appears in the <i>Urine</i>;
and a livid, black, grumous, or nauseous <i>Matter</i> is
excreted.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> proceed various <i>PROGNOSTICKS</i>; viz.
<i>Fevers</i>, <i>Spitting</i> or <i>Vomiting</i> of <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, <i>Melancholy</i>, <i>Inflammations</i>
of the <i>Liver</i>, <i>Quincy</i>, <i>Pleurisy</i>, <i>Frenzy</i>, <i>Dropsy</i>,
<i>Apoplexy</i>, and <i>Madness</i> itself: The <i>least</i> of which may
prove of fatal <i>Consequence</i>, wherefore Delays in this
<i>Condition</i> are most dangerous; because when any of
<i>these</i> heavy <span class='sc'>Symptoms</span> has befallen the <i>Woman</i>, there
is scarce any Hope left for her <i>Recovery</i>; whereas
<i>before</i>, they may be artfully prevented, and the <i>Cure</i>
duly perfected by convenient <i>DIET</i>, <i>Venæsections</i>, <i>Revulsive
Medicines</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> more particularly the <i>Cure</i> ought to vary,
according to the <i>difference</i> of the co-incident <span class='sc'>Symptoms</span>:
For since continual <i>Fevers</i> and <i>Inflammatory
Diseases</i> most commonly follow upon this <i>Suppression</i> or
<i>Diminution</i> of the <span class='sc'>Lochia</span>, we must take great Care
that, endeavouring to promote the <i>FLUX</i>, and to open
the <i>Uterine Vessels</i>, we do not augment the <i>FEVER</i>
and <i>Inflammation</i>; which will certainly happen, (if
without distinction) we use the <i>hot Medicines</i> prescribed
by many <span class='sc'>Authors</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> in this <i>Case</i> repeated <i>Venæsections</i>
sometimes in the <i>Ancle</i>, and sometimes in the
<i>Arm</i>; and <i>cupping Glasses</i> applied to the <i>Thighs</i> and
<i>Shins</i>; as also <i>Rubbing</i> of the <i>Legs</i> and <i>Thighs</i> well,
are generally sufficient <i>Remedies</i>; especially if followed
with one or more Cleansing, or partly opening,
partly cooling, and Emollient <i>CLYSTERS</i>, of a <i>Decoction</i>
of <i>Mallows</i>, <i>Pellitory</i>, or the like; in which strain’d
<i>Liquor</i>, the <i>Pulp</i> of <i>CASSIA</i> with a Dram of <i>Nitre</i>,
and <i>Sugar</i>, and <i>Honey</i> may be dissolved: As also <i>Fomentations</i>
and <i>Fumigations</i> of Emollient and Aperient
<i>Medicines</i> that are not sharp, may be very pertinently
used. Finally, the <i>Infusion</i> of <span class='sc'>Jesuits-Bark</span> in Water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>may be properly given three or four Times a day;
and purging <i>PTISANS</i>, after the <i>first days</i>, are of
good <i>Service</i> in the present <i>Case</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> IV.</span><br /> <i>Of the immoderate Flux of the <em class='gesperrt'>LOCHIA</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> too copious and long lasting, or immoderate
<span class='sc'>Flux</span> of the <i>Child-Bed Purgations</i>, is no less
<i>Preternatural</i>, than the former <i>Case</i> of their being altogether
<i>suppressed</i>, or in part <i>diminished</i>. Tho’ it is
however to be observ’d, that there can be no certain
<i>Quantity</i> of flowing <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, nor any certain <i>Time of
Duration</i> of this <span class='sc'>Flux</span> prefix’d or determined to the
<i>Puerperial Woman</i>, as aforesaid: Wherefore the <i>Excess</i>
of this <i>Evacuation</i> is best known by the <i>Loss of
Strength</i>, <i>sinking of the</i> <span class='sc'>Spirits</span>, and the great <i>Uneasiness</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Patient</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> of this <i>Distemper</i> is, either <i>1st</i>, a too
great <i>Plenty</i> of the abounding <span class='sc'>Blood</span>; or <i>2dly</i>, its
<i>Tenuity</i> and <i>Acrimony</i> stimulating Nature to <i>Excretion</i>;
or <i>3dly</i>, too great an <i>Apertion</i> of the <i>Uterine Vessels</i>; or
<i>4thly</i> and lastly, a violent <i>Extraction</i> of the <i>AFTER-BIRTH</i>:
For the <i>Flux of the LOCHIA</i> proceeding
meerly from the <i>Separation</i> of the <span class='sc'>Placenta</span> from the
<span class='sc'>Womb</span>, the more strong and violent this <i>Separation</i> or
<i>Divulsion</i> is, the more the <i>Vessels</i> in the <i>Concave Part</i>
of the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> are torn or dilacerated; and so being
either too much <i>opened</i>, or too difficult to <i>reconsolidate</i>,
they discharge <span class='sc'>Blood</span> immoderately.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em>, I say, this immoderate <i>FLOODING</i>, is
not only known by the great <i>Quantities</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>BLOOD</em></i>
voided, by its <i>Continuance</i>, or by coming away in <i>Clods</i>,
and much at a time; but also by the <i>Loss of Strength</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>and a <i>Defect</i> of <i>SPIRITS</i>; upon which follows a low,
debilitated and frequent <i><em class='gesperrt'>PULSE</em></i>; Loathing of <i><em class='gesperrt'>VICTUALS</em></i>;
<i>PAINS</i> in the <i>Hypochondriacks</i>, with a <i>Twisting</i>
of the <i>GUTS</i>, and <i>Griping</i> of the <i>BELLY</i>; a <i>Dimness</i>
of <i>SIGHT</i>; a <i>Hissing</i> of the <i>EARS</i>; and at last
<i>Swoonings</i> or <i>Convulsions</i>, proceeding from the <i>Depauperation</i>
of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BLOOD</em></i>: Which after an immoderate
<i>FLUX</i> always disorders the <i>SPIRITS</i>, because when the
<span class='sc'>Mass</span> of it is much lessened, it cannot keep its due
<i>Mixture</i> and <i>Disposition</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this <i>Case</i> the true <span class='sc'>Prognostick</span> is, that, if all
immoderate <i>Hæmorrhagies</i> are dangerous; because by
them, the <i>Treasure</i> of <i>LIFE</i> (the <i>natural Heat</i>) is exhausted:
<i>Then</i>, without Controversy, the immoderate
<i>Flux</i> of the <span class='sc'>Lochia</span>, whether after <span class='sc'>Labour</span>, or after a
<i>MISCARRIAGE</i>, is full of <i>Danger</i>; as coming upon
the <i>PATIENT</i> at a most unseasonable time, when her
<i>Strength</i> is already spent.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cure</i> of this <i>Distemper</i> ought to be well-weigh’d,
and very cautiously perform’d, because the
definite <i>Quantity</i> of <i>BLOOD</i> to be evacuated cannot be
well or certainly known: And because if any Part of
<i>That</i> be stopped, which ought to be ejected, it of course
flows to some <i>other Part</i>, and excites <i>Inflammations</i> or
other heavy <i>SYMPTOMS</i>. Wherefore this is only, in
the Beginning, to be corrected by proper <i><em class='gesperrt'>DIET</em></i>, and
some other convenient light Means: But afterwards
by repeated <i>Venæ-Sections</i> in the <span class='sc'>Arms</span>, if <i>Strength</i> will
permit; and proper <i>Astringents</i> inwardly taken, as well
as outwardly applied; continuing always a <i>Thickening</i>, <i>Cooling</i>,
and <i>Astringent DIET</i>: But farther yet, as the Patient
grows <i>weaker</i>, she ought also to have some <i>corroborative
Remedies</i>, to enable her to stand out the <i>Cure</i>. <i>Fomentations</i>
for the <i>lower Belly</i> of <span class='sc'>Oxycrat</span>, or an astringent
<i>Decoction</i>; <i>Fumigations</i> of the same <i>Decoction</i>, or of hot
<span class='sc'>Oxycrat</span>, are very convenient and helpful on this Occasion,
as are also <i>astringent Injections</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> however sometimes, and not seldom, it happens,
that this <i>Case</i> proceeds from the negligent or ignorant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span><i>MIDWIFE</i>, by her not duly <i>cleansing</i> the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; by
which Means, some part (how small soever) of the
<i>SECUNDINE</i> or <i>Membrane</i>, or some <i>clotted BLOOD</i>,
or perhaps a <i>MOLE</i>, miscall’d a <i>false Conception</i>, may be
left behind in the <span class='sc'>Womb</span>; which distending that <i>Body</i>,
occasions not only an immoderate <span class='sc'>Flux</span>, but also stirs
up violent <span class='sc'>Pains</span>, not unlike to <i>those</i> of <span class='sc'>Labour</span>: In this
pitiful <i>Condition</i>, all possible Diligence must be prudently
used to fetch away and remove this <i>Cause</i>, which is
only most effectually to be done by the <i>Hand-Cure</i>, in
the manner already abundantly set forth.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AFTER</em> which, the <i>PATIENT</i> is to be treated
as <i>before</i>, laying her <i>equally flat upon her Back</i>, and keeping
her very <i>still</i> and <i>quiet</i> in <span class='sc'>Bed</span>; which <span class='sc'>Bed</span> may however
in this <i>Case</i> be kept a little <i>Cool</i>, as well as her
<i>Chamber</i>, lest <span class='sc'>Heat</span> should provoke and continue the
<i>Course</i> of the <span class='sc'>Flux</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, in fine, it also sometimes happens, that
immoderate <i>Purgations</i> proceed from some gross <i>Excrements</i>
contain’d in the <span class='sc'>Rectum</span> antecedent to the Time
of <span class='sc'>Labour</span>; which, as they puff up the <i>Belly</i>, so they
also commonly occasion severe <span class='sc'>Cholicks</span>; but these being
discreetly evacuated by a pretty strong emollient
<span class='sc'>Clyster</span>, the <span class='sc'>Flooding</span> immediately ceases.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> V.</span><br /> <i>Of the Acute Distempers incident to CHILD-BED-WOMEN.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>WE</em> are in this place only to consider the <i>Acute
Distempers</i> of the <i>Puerperial Woman</i>, because the
Time of <i>lying-in</i> is not of such a long <i>Continuance</i> as to
admit of <i>Chronick Diseases</i>: And these <i>Acute Ones</i>, in
short, which they are most commonly subject to, are
continual <span class='sc'>Fevers</span>, (Either, 1. <i>Essential</i>, that is, <span class='sc'>Fevers</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>proceeding first from the <span class='sc'>Blood</span>; or, 2. <i>Symptomatick</i> <span class='sc'>Fevers</span>,
that is, such as follow upon the internal <i>Inflammations</i>,
which often attend the <i>Child-Bed-Woman</i>;) as also
<i>Frenzies</i>, <i>Watchings</i>, <i>Lethargies</i>, <i>Convulsions</i>, <i>Epilepsies</i>, &amp;c.—</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> more especially there is <i>one</i> particular kind of
<span class='sc'>Fever</span>, which invades almost all labouring <i>Women</i> the
third or fourth Day after the <i>BIRTH</i>, and is commonly
call’d the <i>MILK-FEVER</i>; because about that time,
the <i>MILK</i> begins to generate more plentifully in the
<span class='sc'>Breasts</span>, taking its <i>Rise</i> from the Motion and Agitation
of the <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, which converts it from the <span class='sc'>Womb</span> to the
<span class='sc'>Breasts</span>. This <i>Distemper</i>, resolving itself about the
ninth Day by <span class='sc'>Sweat</span>, is of no dangerous <i>Consequence</i>;
provided the <i>PATIENT</i> observes a good and proper
<span class='sc'>Diet</span>, and duly prevents all <i>Cold</i>, that might readily
stop the <span class='sc'>Sweat</span>, and carefully preserves the <span class='sc'>Milk</span> from
<i>coagulating</i> or <i>putrefying</i> in her <span class='sc'>Breasts</span>, whence the
<i>Symptomatick FEVERS</i> commonly arise: Wherefore, I
say, this <i>MILK-FEVER</i>, being of the extended <i>Ephemerick</i>
Sort, and ceasing of itself, requires no great
<i>Cure</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ONLY</em> in this <i>Case</i>, it is a vulgar <i>Error</i> among the
<i>good Women</i>, that because this <i>FEVER</i> lasts only four
or five Days at most, coming on about the fourth, and
ending about the ninth Day after the <i>BIRTH</i>, they
take all <i>Fevers</i> in this time, for the <i>MILK-FEVER</i>;
and consequently thro’ this <i>Mistake</i>, neglecting, or not
regarding duly the true <i>Condition</i>, the <span class='sc'>Patient</span> is very
often endanger’d: Which <i>Mistake</i>, that they may for
the future diligently avoid, I shall subjoin here some
certain <span class='sc'>Signs</span> of <i>Distinction</i> in due Course. But previously——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Causes</i> of all <i>FEVERS</i> incident to the <i>Child-Bed-Woman</i>,
are either the <i>Suppression</i> of the <span class='sc'>Lochia</span> in
whole or in part; or the vitious <i>Quality</i> of the <i>Humours</i>
accumulated in <i>Gestation</i>, and exasperated in the <span class='sc'>Birth</span>;
or a vitious irregular <i>DIET</i> in the time of <i>lying-in</i>; or
the cold <span class='sc'>Air</span>, or any such <i>Accident</i> by bad Management,
may readily convert the <i>MILK-FEVER</i> into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>putrid and dangerous <i>one</i>; as a latent <i>CACOCHYMY</i>
may also easily dispose it to <i>Corruption</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> true <i>DIAGNOSTICKS</i>, in my Opinion, are
as follow, <i>viz.</i> <span class='sc'>First</span>, the <i>MILK-FEVER</i> is known
from hence, that it always begins about the <i>Fourth
Day</i>, when the <i>BREASTS</i> begin to fill with <i>MILK</i>;
and then the <i>LOCHIA</i> flowing regularly, the <i>Woman</i>
finds a certain <i>Gravity</i> or Weight in her <i>Back</i> and <i>Shoulders</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em>, <span class='sc'>Secondly</span>, when the <i><em class='gesperrt'>LOCHIA</em></i> are <i>suppressed</i>,
whether in whole, or in part, ’tis then certain
that the present <i><em class='gesperrt'>FEVER</em></i> proceeds from thence; the
<i>BELLY</i> thereby swells and is puffed up, as also it is
<i>pained</i> when <i>touched</i>; and the <i>Humours</i>, at last, putrefying
in the <i>WOMB</i>, it ejects a certain <i>fœtid or corrupt
Matter</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREAS</em>, <span class='sc'>Thirdly</span>, if the <i>FEVER</i> neither
proceeds from the <i>MILK</i>, nor from any Irregularity of
the <i>LOCHIA</i>, why then it must necessarily either proceed
from the <i>vitious Quality</i> and Preparation of the
<i>Humours</i>; or from a <i>Cacochymical Habit</i> of Body; or from
an <i>irregular Way of Living</i> in time of <i>GESTATION</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> most certain <i>PROGNOSTICKS</i> are as follow,
<i>viz.</i> <span class='sc'>First</span>, All <i>Acute Diseases</i> in <i>Child-bed Women</i>,
whose <i>Strength</i> is impaired by their <i><em class='gesperrt'>LABOUR</em></i>, are
much more dangerous than in any <i>Others</i>. <span class='sc'>Secondly</span>,
These which proceed from the <i>Suppression</i> of the <i>LOCHIA</i>
are most dangerous; because the <i>Humours</i> putrefying
in the <i>WOMB</i>, occasion most severe <i>SYMPTOMS</i>,
yea and too commonly <i>DEATH</i> itself, unless a lucky
<i>Diarrhæa</i>, or a timely <i>Ejection</i> of the corrupted Matter,
prevents the <i>Misfortune</i>. <span class='sc'>Thirdly</span>, The self-same
is the unfortunate <i>Consequence</i>, when the <i>Distemper</i> proceeds
from the vitious <i>HUMOURS</i>; for <i>Nature</i> then
not being able to expurgate their abounding Superfluity
by the <i>LOCHIA</i>, the <i>PATIENT</i> must needs be greatly
endanger’d, if not overwhelm’d.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> most adviseable <i>Cure</i>, <span class='sc'>First</span>, as to the <i>MILK-FEVER</i>,
is only to be committed to <i>Nature</i>, the <i>Woman</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>using always a proper <i><em class='gesperrt'>DIET</em></i>, and carefully animadverting,
that the <i>SWEAT</i>, in which it commonly
terminates, be no ways checked, impeded, or obstructed.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, As to the <i>Watchings</i>, <i>Deliria’s</i>, <i>Epilepsies</i>,
&amp;c. which the <i>PATIENT</i> is subject to in this
Condition; as they proceed only from <i>Vapours</i> of the
<i>BLOOD</i> and <i>Humours</i>, ascending to the <i>Head</i>, when the
<i>LOCHIA</i> do not flow regularly, or when the <i>Woman</i> is
<i>Feverish</i>: So the <i>Cure</i> of these distemper’d <i>Cases</i> depends
(at first) chiefly upon retracting the <i>HUMOURS</i> from
the <i>Head</i> to the inferiour Parts, and correcting the
<i>Course</i> of the <i>LOCHIA</i>: Because, if these flow orderly,
and the vitious <i>Humours</i>, from which such depraved
<i>Vapours</i> as affect the <i>Head</i>, be removed and evacuated,
all such <i>SYMPTOMS</i> quickly cease and vanish of their
own Accord.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIRDLY</em>, in the other above-mentioned <i>Cases</i>, the
<i>PATIENT</i> ought always to be treated according to the
various Circumstances of her <i>Condition</i>; I mean, according
to the attending <i>SYMPTOMS</i>, conformable also
to which the ingenious <i>Physician</i> will always judiciously
take his prudent Measures: Since the <i>Cure</i>
does not always depend upon the <i>same Method</i>; especially
when a <i>symptomatick</i>, or concomitant <i><em class='gesperrt'>FEVER</em></i>,
joins the <i>first</i>, as it very often happens, by an <i>Inflammation</i>
of some <i>particular Part</i>, proceeding from something
of the vitious <i><em class='gesperrt'>HUMOURS</em></i> enforcing itself upon the
same very <i>Part</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em>, in short, tho’ such <i>Inflammations</i> may affect
any <i>Part</i> of the Body, yet (I think) the most common
<i>Case</i> is, that which affects the <i>PLEURA</i>; and from
hence (the <i>Pleurisy</i> joining the <i>FEVER</i>) the <i>Woman</i>
labours under both these complicated <i>Acute Diseases</i> at
once. The <i>Cure</i> of which difficult and dangerous <i>Condition</i>
belongs only to the ablest <i>Physician</i>, to whom
I should be justly censured, in impertinently offering
any <i>Instruction</i> upon this Subject. Finally, in a
word, from what has been said in the <i>Chapter</i> of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span><i>Acute Diseases</i> of Women with <i>CHILD</i><a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c017'><sup>[181]</sup></a>, we may more
fully gather what is to be prudently done to Women
in <i>CHILD-BED</i>, afflicted with the like <i>Distempers</i>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em> then, Because these <i>accidental</i> Distempers are
very many and numerous, as well as various and
different in <i>Kind</i>: SECONDLY, Because <i>some</i> of them
have been already treated, or occasionally discoursed upon
at large: And, THIRDLY, because <i>others</i> are only
to be named in this Place; I shall take leave to include
and comprehend them all, for <i>Brevity’s</i> sake, in this present
<i>Chapter</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> order to which, I may first observe, that most
(if not All) of these unfortunate <i>Accidents</i>, depend entirely
upon the indiscreet <i>Conduct</i> of the <i>MIDWIFE</i> in
time of <i>LABOUR</i>, or the <i>ill Management</i> of the <i>Woman</i>
after the <i>BIRTH</i>: Since by the prudent and judicious
<i>Means</i> of the expert <i>MIDWIFE</i>, many <i>Accidents</i> may
be prevented, which otherways must necessarily happen,
especially in difficult or <i>preternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em></i>;
as also, on the other hand, by treating the <i>Woman</i>
orderly, and guiding her carefully, many <i>Distempers</i>
may be totally averted, which otherways will inevitably
seize the <i>PATIENT</i>. As for Instance——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> sometimes happens, that she is troubled with a
<i>Prolapse</i>, or bearing down of the <i>WOMB</i>, or <i>Vagina</i>, or
<i>Both</i>; as also sometimes with a <i>Falling out of the FUNDAMENT</i>:
In all which unhappy <i>Conditions</i> the industrious
<i>MIDWIFE</i> will find her <i>Instructions</i>, not only
with respect to the <i>Cure</i>, but also with respect to the
<i>Prevention</i> (which concerns her most) particularly set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>down and accounted for in <i><em class='gesperrt'>SECT.</em></i> V. <i>Chap.</i> 10, and 11.
as she will also, upon <i>Perusal</i>, find the <i>Method</i> of preventing
that deplorable <i>Accident</i>, of making a <i>Rupture</i> in,
or renting the <i>Perinæum</i>, in <i>Chap.</i> 9.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in <i>case</i> of <i>Contusions</i>, or Smaller <i>Rents</i> in the
<i>VULVA</i>, or <i>Vagina</i>, which sometimes cannot be well
prevented, especially in the <i>First BIRTHS</i>; <i>such</i> are by
no means to be neglected, lest they degenerate into
malignant <i>ULCERS</i>: Wherefore they ought to be <i>cured</i>,
as soon as possible, after the <i>Woman’s <em class='gesperrt'>DELIVERY</em></i>;
which <i>Cure</i> is easily performed, when taken in hand
<i>betimes</i>, by proper <i>Fomentations</i>, and convenient <i><em class='gesperrt'>CATAPLASMS</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SOMETIMES</em> again, the <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>, the <i>Belly</i>, and
the <i>Feet</i> swell much after the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTH</em></i>; which <i>SYMPTOMS</i>
commonly proceed from some <i>Cold</i>, or from
<i>drinking too much</i>, or from either a <i>Suppression</i> or <i>Diminution</i>
of the <i>LOCHIA</i>, or from any <i>irregular way of Living</i>
during the time of <i><em class='gesperrt'>GESTATION</em></i>: By which
means the vitious <i>HUMOURS</i>, resolving themselves into
<i>Flatulencies</i>, swell and puff up both the <i>WOMB</i> and
the <i>ABDOMEN</i>; and these <i>Winds</i> descending, have
the same Effect upon the <i>Legs</i>. But the <i>Cure</i>, however,
of all such <i>SYMPTOMS</i>, is readily accomplished by convenient
<i>DIET</i>, proper <i>Fomentations</i>, and discutient <i>Medicines</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> I might orderly descend to an <i>Indefinity</i> of
Particulars, deriving from the following general <i>Heads</i>,
which I Shall only name at this time; <i>viz.</i> the various
<i>Diseases</i> of the <i>PUDENDUM</i> and <i>Vagina</i>, as well as of
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MATRIX</em></i> itself, together with their <i>co-incident
SYMPTOMS</i>; as also the divers <i>Distempers</i>, and different
<i>SYMPTOMS</i> of the <i>Woman’s <em class='gesperrt'>BREASTS</em></i>. But
<i>These Subjects</i> being as different as numerous (which I
have already hinted) I must refer them to another Opportunity;
being resolved to keep the present Work, for
the common Good, within the <i>Purchase</i> of all sorts of
People as far as possible; and until such time as something
on <i>these Heads</i> appears more judicious or elaborate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>either from <i>my own</i>, or some more <i>capable Hand</i>, I hope
<i>English Women</i> can be at no great Loss for good <i>Instruction</i>,
or ready <i>Assistance</i>; especially not in this famous
<i>City</i> of <span class='sc'>London</span>, which is, by the Divine Mercy, abundantly
well-stock’d, and singularly well provided, with
some of the most excellent <i>Physicians</i> of the Age, as well
as with some very ingenious <i>Practisers</i> in the Art of
<i>MIDWIFERY</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em>, thus, in fine, having <i>piloted</i> the good <i>Woman</i>
(as it were) thro’ the <i>three Gulphs</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><i>GESTATION</i></em>;
<i>BIRTH</i>, and <i>CHILD-BED</i>, and at last brought
her into safe <i>Harbour</i>; we may now (I hope) securely
leave her there, to <i>refit</i> for the same prosperous <i>Voyage</i>
again; whilst we, in the next Place, undertake to
provide for the <i>Safety</i> of her <i><em class='gesperrt'>CARGO</em></i>, or direct the

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VII.</span><br /> <i>Of the Constriction of the NAVEL-STRING, and the Swaddling of the Infant</i>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> after the <i>Torrents</i> of Difficulties and <i>Oceans</i> of Danger
that the <span class='sc'>Mother</span> has painfully gone through,
and narrowly evaded, the <span class='sc'>Child</span> should at last be lost;
the <i>Comfort</i> of her <i>Burden</i> would be but small, and the
<i>Reward</i> of her <i>Sufferings</i> but very little: Wherefore
special <i>Care</i> ought to be taken to prevent such melancholy
<i>Events</i>; in order to which, we are not only to
remedy such <i>Indispositions</i> as it (too often) brings with
it into the World, but also to defend it from the many
periculous <i>Contingencies</i>, to which the <i>Tenderness</i> of its
Body, and the <i>Debility</i> of its Age expose it.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> first <i>Duty</i> then, that the <i>INFANT</i> requires
of us after <i>BIRTH</i>, whether born by the <i>Head</i>, or extracted
by the <i>Feet</i>, is the <i>tying</i> and <i>cutting</i> of the <i>Umbilical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>Vein</i>, or <i>NAVEL-STRING</i>; which being a thing
generally well known, I shall have no Occasion to insist
upon it, especially since tho’ the common <span class='sc'>Gossips</span> may
differ in the <i>Performance</i>, yet they always agree in the
<i>Fact</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, that we may not pass this <i>essential
Point</i> by in Silence, in case a notable Word may drop by
the By, I would,——</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>OBSERVE</em>, that, until the <i>STRING</i> be cut, the
<span class='sc'>Child</span> is to be carefully laid on <i>one Side</i>, not on its
<i>Back</i>, for fear that the <i><em class='gesperrt'>HUMOURS</em></i>, running to its
<i>Mouth</i> or <i>Nose</i>, may choke it, for want of free Evacuation.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. I would take notice, that, if need require, while
the <i>MIDWIFE</i> is busy about the <i>Mother</i>, in extracting
the <i>AFTER-BIRTH</i>, cleansing the <i>WOMB</i>, &amp;c. the
most capable of the <span class='sc'>Gossips</span> should <i>tie</i> and <i>cut</i> the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>STRING</em></i>, especially if the <i>INFANT</i> is weak or ill;
otherways it may be deferred until the <i>Woman</i> be entirely
<i>delivered</i>, and fairly <i>laid</i>. Then,——</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the <i>Performance</i> of this Matter, it may
be <i>tied</i> with a good strong <i>Thread</i>, laid four or five-fold,
according to its Strength; and the <span class='sc'>Knot</span> tied close
within <i>two Inches</i> of the <i>CHILD’s</i> Body: Tho’, I say,
that the <span class='sc'>Knot</span> is to be <i>tied</i> close, yet it must not be so
strictly <i>tied</i> as to cut asunder the <i>STRING</i>; which
might easily happen, especially to the <i>INFANTS</i> of a
tenderer Constitution. And the Reason that I would
have the <i>Constriction</i> made <i>two Inches</i> from the Body, is
this, That in case any <i>Blood</i> should happen to drop out
afterwards (as it often happens) there may be <i>room</i>
enough to <i>tie</i> it again nearer the <i>NAVEL</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>THE <i>STRING</i></em> is not to be <i>cut off</i> close to
the <span class='sc'>Knot</span>, but also <i>two or three Inches</i> from it; so that,
if it happens to swell with Wind (as is very common)
after being <i>tied</i>, it may be <i>loosed</i> again, the <i>Wind</i> discharged,
and itself conveniently <i>retied</i>. But the far
better and preferable way is, to tie this <span class='sc'>Vein</span> in <i>two
Places</i>, and cut it asunder betwixt the <i>Ligatures</i>; being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>thereby secure from losing <span class='sc'>Blood</span>. Some (I know)
will not have the <span class='sc'>Vein</span> to be <i>tied</i> before the <i>CHILD</i>
cries or makes <i>Water</i>; but, however, long <i>Delays</i> in
this <i>Case</i> are no ways convenient, nor without Danger.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <span class='sc'>Vein</span> or <span class='sc'>String</span> being <i>cut</i>, must be
wrapped up in a <i>three</i> or <i>fourfold Rag</i>, to defend the
<i>BABE</i> from Cold or Pains of the <i>Belly</i>; which otherways
might ensue from the <i>naked</i> <span class='sc'>Vein</span>’s lying upon its
Body: Which being done, this Part of the <span class='sc'>String</span> is
to be laid on the <i>upper Part of the Belly</i>, with a small
<i>Boulster</i> on the Top of it; and then swathed with a
<i>Linnen Swath</i> of about <i>four Inches broad</i>, to keep it firm
and steady.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> first time that the <i>CHILD</i> is <i>unswathed</i>,
a new <span class='sc'>Knot</span> ought to be made or <i>tied</i>, and that to prevent
all <i>Danger</i> by Loss of <i>BLOOD</i>, which may readily
happen by the first <span class='sc'>Knot</span>’s relaxing, as the <i>STRING</i>
begins to wither away or contract.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> being so duly taken care of, it remains only
in general, that the Infant be presently <i>washed</i>, cleansed,
and examined all over, and at last orderly <i>swaddled</i>.
All which if the <i>MIDWIFE</i> does not perform with her
own Hands, she ought at least to see it carefully accomplished:
Upon which she may then say, she has
faithfully discharged her <i>Duty</i> to both the <i>MOTHER</i>
and the <i>CHILD</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. <em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> more particularly, in the <i>seventh Place</i>,
I must take notice, that as soon as the <i>NAVEL-STRING</i>
is thus duly handled and provided for, the
<i>INFANT</i> is to be tenderly cleansed of the adhering
<i>Excrements</i>, and washed all over in a little warm <i>Wine</i>,
<i>Milk</i>, or <i>Ale</i>; especially its <i>Head</i>, <i>Arm-Pits</i>, <i>Groins</i>,
<i>Cods</i>, or <i>Privities</i>, &amp;c. are to be softly cleansed and
gently bathed with a soft <i>Spunge</i> or <i>Rag</i>, dipt in the
same <i>Liquors</i>: But if the <i>viscous Matter</i> sticks too fast
or close to the tender Body, a little <i>Oil of sweet Almonds</i>,
or fresh <i>Butter</i>, may be added to either of the foresaid
<i>Liquors</i>. As also the <i>Ears</i> and <i>Nostrils</i> ought to be
well cleansed and unstopped with small Tents of <i>fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>Rags</i> wet therein; and the <i>Eyes</i> wiped with a soft dry
<i>Cloth</i>; as the <i>Mouth</i>, <i>Tongue</i>, and <i>Jaws</i> may be cleans’d
by the <i>Finger</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. <em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> things being all very carefully and
tenderly performed, every Part of the Body ought to
be diligently searched, in case of a <i>Dislocation</i>, or any
other <i>Accident</i>, happened by <i>Violence</i> in the <i>BIRTH</i>, or
otherways; that present <i>Remedies</i> may be used, according
to the Nature of the <i>Circumstances</i>: And especially
the two <i>Conduits</i> of the <i>URINE</i> and <i>ORDURE</i> are to
be examined; since it sometimes falls out that <i>these</i> are
not perforated, and consequently that the <i>Meconium</i>
cannot be voided, which inevitably proves fatal, unless
timely <i>Care</i> be taken.</p>

<p class='c005'>IX. <em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the <i>URINE</i>, all <i>Children</i> discharge it as
soon as born, at least as soon as they feel the <i>Heat</i> of
the Fire; when if the <i>Excrements</i>, properly called <i>MECONIUM</i>,
tho’ improperly <i>COLLOSTRO</i> by the <i>Italians</i>,
do not follow a little after; I mean within an <i>Hour or
two</i>; then a small <i>Suppository</i> may be used, such as a <i>sugar’d
Almond</i> anointed with a little boiled <i>Honey</i>; or a
Piece of <i>Venice-Soap</i> anointed with fresh <i>Butter</i>; as also
a little <i>Syrup</i> of <i>Roses</i> or <i>Violets</i>, mixed with the Oil of
<i>sweet Almonds</i> by Expression, that is, drawn without
Fire, may be given in the <i>Mouth</i>, anointing the <i>Belly</i>
with the same <i>Oil</i>, or with fresh <i>Butter</i>; in like manner
as a small <i>Clyster</i> (upon occasion) may be discreetly
used and managed to purpose.</p>

<p class='c005'>X. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>INFANT</i> being in these respects <i>provided</i>
for, it is now to be duly dressed and swaddled in its
<i>Swathing-Cloathes</i>; and beginning with the <i><em class='gesperrt'>HEAD</em></i>, a
<i>Compress</i> of a three or fourfold fine <i>Linnen Rag</i>, about
<i>four Inches broad</i>, is to be applied to the <i>MOULD</i>, for
defending the (yet open) <i>BRAIN</i> from <i>Cold</i>, &amp;c. which
<i>Compress</i> is to be carefully covered with, and pinned to
the ordinary <i>CAPS</i> made on purpose. Next then, some
small soft <i>RAGS</i> are to be laid behind the <i>Ears</i>, upon
the <i>Breast</i>, in the <i>Arm-Pits</i>, and the <i>Groins</i>; after which
the <i>BABE</i> is to be wrapped softly up in <i>warm Blankets</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>and discreetly <i>swathed</i>; not too strait, especially not
about the <i>Breast</i> and <i>Stomach</i>, that it may <i>breathe</i> the
freer, and the better retain the <i>MILK</i> it sucks. The
<i>ARMS</i> are to be stretched along the <i>Sides</i>, and the
<i>LEGS</i> equally <i>streight</i>, with a little of the <i>Bed</i> betwixt
them; and the <i>HEAD</i> is always to be kept steady, as
the whole <i>CHILD</i> is to be preserved <i>thus</i> warmly wrapped
up, and judiciously appointed. But now because
the <i>INFANT</i> is commonly committed to the <i>Nurse’s
Care</i>, I shall, in the next Place, enter upon the <i>Description</i>
of the proper <i>Person</i> for that purpose.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VIII.</span><br /> <i>Of the <em class='gesperrt'>NURSE</em> and her Regimen, together with the requisite Qualities of her MILK.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THO’</em> the <i>BABE</i> may be brought up by the
Hand only, without <i>Suckling</i>, as many Instances
of very thriving <i>Children</i> testify; yet because the most
natural, common, and commendable way is to <i>suckle</i> it,
I come now to touch upon the proper <i>NURSE</i>, her
<i>Milk</i>, and <i>Diet</i>. Upon which I first observe, that the
prime and chief <i>Quality</i> of a good <i>NURSE</i> is, that she
be the <i>Mother</i> of the <i>Fosterling INFANT</i> herself; and
that because her <i>MILK</i>, being generated of the same
<i>Blood</i>, of which the <i>CHILD</i> is formed, and has hitherto
been nourished, is of a nearer <i>Affinity</i> with the Nature
of her <i>BABE</i>, than the <i>MILK</i> of any <i>other strange
Woman</i> whatsoever; which can differ no less from the
<i>Maternal Milk</i>, than the own <i>Mother</i>, and the <i>other</i> differ
in <i>Constitution</i> and <i>Temperament</i> of Body, <i>Regimen</i>, and
<i>Method of Living</i>, &amp;c. All which affect the <i>INFANT</i>
in no small Degree; for as the <span class='sc'>Blood</span> is generated of
the <i>Chyle</i>, and the <i>Spirits</i> of the <span class='sc'>Blood</span>, so the <i>CHILD</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>imbibes the very <i>Manners</i> and <i>Disposition</i>, as well as the
gross <i>Humours</i> and <i>Qualities</i> of the <i>NURSE</i> with her <i>Milk</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> a <i>Lamb</i> sucking a <i>Goat</i>, changes not only its
<i>Nature</i>, but even its <i>Skin</i> and <i>Wool</i> into the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Goat</em></span>-<i>Kind</i>;
so it is also among the <i>rational Creatures</i>: From
hence we have justly the <i>old Proverb</i>, touching an <i>ill-natured
Person</i>, that some <i>Brute</i> or other has been his
<i>NURSE</i>. And hence it is that <i>Romulus</i> and <i>Remus</i>, the
Sons of <span class='sc'>Mars</span> (without any Reality) are said to have
been nursed by a <span class='sc'>Wolf</span><a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c017'><sup>[182]</sup></a>; <i>Pelias</i>, the Son of <i>Neptune</i>,
by a <span class='sc'>Mare</span>; <i>Telephus</i>, the Son of <i>Hercules</i>, by a <span class='sc'>Hind</span>,
&amp;c. Not that they ever actually sucked such <i>Creatures</i>,
only their <i>NURSES</i> were of such <i>Tempers</i> and <i>Natures</i>,
which they were thus supposed to have by the <span class='sc'>Breast</span>
infused into them.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em>, in short, daily <i>Experience</i>, as well as many
<i>Learned Authorities</i>, may sufficiently convince us, that
<span class='sc'>Children</span> really <i>suck</i> in the several <i>vitious Inclinations</i>
and <i>depraved Passions</i> of their <i>NURSES</i>; such as <i>Anger</i>,
<i>Malice</i>, <i>Fear</i>, <i>Melancholy</i>, &amp;c. Agreeable to which Opinion,
<i>Diodorus</i> says<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c017'><sup>[183]</sup></a>, that <i>Nero</i> the Emperor’s <i>NURSE</i>
was very much addicted to <i>Drinking</i>; which Habit <i>Nero</i>
imbibed from <i>her</i>, to such a Degree, that the People
took notice of it, and from thence instead of <span class='sc'>Claudius
Tiberius Nero</span>, call’d him <i>Caldius Biberius Mero</i>.
The same Author relates of <i>Caligula</i>, that his <i>NURSE</i>
used frequently to moisten her <i>Nipples</i> with <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span>,
that he might take the better hold of them; which
(says the same <i>Diodorus</i>) was the <i>Cause</i> of his being so
cruel and <i>Blood-thirsty</i> all the Days of his Life; that he
not only committed frequent <i>Murders</i> by his own Hand,
but even wished that all humane Race was but one
<span class='sc'>Neck</span>, that he might have the pleasure to <i>cut it off</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> short, <i>honest Parents</i> perceiving their <i>Children</i> to
incline variously, <i>one</i> to <i>Thieving</i>, <i>another</i> to <i>Drinking</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span><i>one</i> to <i>Stupidity</i>, <i>another</i> to <i>Barbarity</i>; are amazed at such
<i>Degeneracies</i> of Mankind, not knowing after whom the
<i>Child</i> can take those Propensions. But abstracting from
<i>this</i>, how many fine <i>Children</i> do we daily see thrown
into <i>Fits</i>, <i>Rickets</i>, <i>Consumptions</i>, &amp;c. merely by <i>sucking</i>
their imprudent <i>NURSES</i>, when enraged, or otherways
in a Passion? If then the <i>Case</i> stands thus, that every
<i>Disorder</i> of the <i>NURSE</i> is a real <i>Detriment</i> to the <i>INFANT</i>,
surely, upon this Account, all <i>Parents</i> ought
to know <span class='sc'>Her</span> well, to whom they entrust these <i>Dear
Pledges</i> of their sacred and natural Desires.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em> yet, besides all these Things, the
tender <i>Care</i>, as well as the <i>Love</i> and <i>Affection</i> of the
<span class='sc'>Mother</span> to her own <span class='sc'>Child</span>, by far surpasses that of any
<i>mercenary <em class='gesperrt'>NURSE</em></i> whatsoever. Wherefore the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>,
tho’ perhaps not the best <i><em class='gesperrt'>NURSE</em></i> in other respects,
is always preferable to a <i>STRANGER</i>: Which
if People of <i>Probity</i> and <i>Honour</i> would more observe, I
sincerely believe that there would not be so many graceless,
disobedient, and undutiful <i>CHILDREN</i> of our
Age. I do not think what I have read of <i>Scipio Africanus</i>
to be any singular <i>Instance</i>; namely, that He
esteemed <i>Her</i> more for his <span class='sc'>Mother</span>, who nursed him
two Years after his <i>Birth</i>, than <span class='sc'>Her</span> who brought him
forth, and then forsook him in the World. Agreeable
to which, and most <i>à propos</i>, was the Answer of the
Philosopher, <i>Favorinus</i><a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c017'><sup>[184]</sup></a>, to the <span class='sc'>Mother</span> of a certain
<i>Noble-woman</i> in <i>CHILD-BED</i>, who was dissuading her
<i>Daughter</i> to <i>nurse</i> the <i>CHILD</i> she had born; <i>viz.</i> <i>I entreat
thee Woman</i> (says he) <i>suffer her to be the whole and
entire Mother of her own Son</i>. And verily, <span class='sc'>She</span> only can
be properly so called, who carefully <i>nurses</i> as well as
<i>brings forth</i> her own <i>CHILDREN</i>. Hence it is that the
<i>Earth</i> is called the <span class='sc'>Mother</span> of all Things, not so much
because she produces all Things, as because she <i>maintains</i>
and <i>nurses</i> what she produces.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span><em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> which, notwithstanding, there is sometimes a
<i>Necessity</i> (on account of sundry Reasons) to provide
another <i>NURSE</i> for the <i>CHILD</i>; wherefore I come
now briefly to describe the most proper <i>Person</i> for this
<i>TRUST</i>, and to set forth the <i>Qualities</i> of the most convenient
<i>MILK</i>, for the wholesome Nourishment of the
<span class='sc'>Infant</span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>FIRST then, the <i><em class='gesperrt'>NURSE</em></i> ought to be a Woman
between the 20th and 35th <i>Year of her Age</i>, perfectly
graced with the <i>Blessings</i> and <i>Ornaments</i> of <i>Nature</i>; and
a Person of <i>Probity</i> and <i>Reputation</i> in her <i>Rank</i>, endued
with <i>Love</i>, <i>Pity</i>, and <i>Tender-heartedness</i>: As she also
ought to be <i>sound</i> and <i>healthy</i>, of a good <i>Habit</i> and <i>Disposition</i>
of Body and Mind, of a sanguine <i>Complexion</i>,
and rosy <i>Colour</i>; of a <i>middle Stature</i>, having black or
brown <i>Hair</i>, a <i>lively Eye</i>, <i>sweet Breath</i>, sound and white
<i>Teeth</i>, with an agreeable chearful <i>Countenance</i>. In short,
she ought also to be a <i>well-mannered</i>, <i>modest</i>, and <i>sober
Person</i>, having middle-sized, well shaped, not flabby
nor hanging down, but solid fleshy <span class='sc'>Breasts</span>, with elegant,
firm, and well perforated <i>Nipples</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>SECONDLY, As to her <i>MILK</i>, it ought neither to
be too <i>new</i>, nor too <i>old</i>; but at any time from the <i>Puerperial
Flux</i>, until the 6th or 8th Month thereafter, it
is not to be rejected; especially if it be of a good <i>Consistence</i>,
neither too <i>thick</i> nor too <i>thin</i>, of a pure <i>white
Colour</i>, an agreeable pleasant <i>Smell</i>, and a perfect sweet
<i>Taste</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>BUT it sometimes however happens, that the <i>Milk</i>
of a <i>NURSE</i>, otherways a very <i>proper Person</i>, degenerates
from some of the abovesaid <i>Qualities</i>: In which
<i>Case</i> it is no ways convenient to change the <i><em class='gesperrt'>NURSE</em></i>,
especially if it so happen to the <span class='sc'>Mother</span>; only the
<i>MILK</i> is to be corrected according to <i>Art</i>, which may
be easily performed by proper <i>Medicinal Means</i>, and that
as well with respect to its <i>Quality</i> as <i>Quantity</i>: However,
as <i>this Case</i> belongs to the <i>SYMPTOMS</i> of the <i>Breasts</i>,
which I have already declined speaking to, as in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>foregoing <i>Chapter</i>, so I shall no ways enter upon it in
this Place. But again——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIRDLY</em> as to her <i>Regimen</i>, such a <span class='sc'>Nurse</span>
is to make use of, and enjoy a good and convenient
<i>Diet</i>; abstaining carefully from all <i>salt</i> and <i>sharp Victuals</i>,
as well as from high-spiced <i>Meats</i>, and strong or spirituous
<i>Liquors</i>. In short, as she ought to avoid all Sorts of
<i>intemperate Air</i>, and keep herself clean both in <i>Person</i>
and <i>Cloaths</i>; so she ought always to exercise herself
by some light <i>Labour</i>, and keep herself in a moderate
active Motion; prudently suppressing, at all Times and
upon all Occasions, the various <i>Passions of the Mind</i>:
By which means, any <i>Woman</i> as above described, may
make a very good <i>NURSE</i>, and that even without
abstaining altogether either from the moderate Use of
<i>Wine</i>, or of <i>Conjugal Conversation</i>; notwithstanding the
contrary Opinion of most <i>Authors</i>, provided only that
she does not give the <i>CHILD suck</i> for an Hour or two
after <i>Copulation</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> IX.</span><br /> <i>Of the Diet and Ablactation, together with the farther Regimen of the <em class='gesperrt'>CHILD</em>.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>BESIDES</em> the <i>external</i> and <i>internal Excrements</i>
mention’d in the foregoing <i>Chapter</i>, the <span class='sc'>Infant</span>
in a few days after <i>BIRTH</i>, pukes up a certain Sort
of <i>viscid Phlegm</i>; for which Reason it ought to have
no <i>SUCK</i> until this <i>Humour</i> be evacuated, lest the
<span class='sc'>Milk</span> incorporating with that Matter, <i>both</i> should
corrupt: To prevent which Inconveniency, <i>some</i>
order a little <i>Oil of sweet Almonds by Expression</i>, and a
small Quantity of <i>Sugar-Candy</i>, or a little fresh <i>Butter</i>
and <i>Honey</i> mixed.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>INSTEAD of which, however, I have seen some
<i>Jewish Matrons</i> give also the new-born <span class='sc'>Child</span> for the
first Thing, a little <span class='sc'>Salt</span> dissolv’d and mix’d in a
Spoonful of <i>Hysop</i>, or <i>Saxifrage-Water</i>; which (tho’
no improper <i>Prescription</i> in itself) yet I conceive their
chief Reason for it to proceed from <i>Ezek.</i> 16. 4. where
the <span class='sc'>Lord</span> summing up the Duty of the <i>MIDWIFE</i>, says,
<i>Thou wast not salted at all</i>, &amp;c. Again farther——</p>

<p class='c005'>THE Learned <i>Arnoldus de Villa Nova</i>, advises us to
give the <i>CHILD</i>, for the first Thing, half a Scruple
of fine <i>pulverized Coral</i> in a little of the <i>Woman’s
MILK</i>; and that (says he) to prevent <i>FITS</i>, to which
new-born <i>Children</i> are very subject.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ALL</em> which may be indifferently us’d, according to
Pleasure, tho’ I take a small Spoonful of <i>Sugar’d Wine</i>,
given twice or thrice a day, for the first four or five
days running, to be the most preferable <i>Remedy</i> for
Prevention: By reason that the <i>Wine</i> cuts and loosens
the <i>Acid Humour</i>, preparing afterwards by <i>Concoction</i>
and <i>Digestion</i> what remains, as the <i>Sugar</i> temperates and
helps to expurge the <i>Acrimony</i>: Which being duly
done, I would order the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> always to rest, laying
it not on its <i>Back</i>, but on its <i>Side</i>, that this <i>morbifick
Matter</i> may be the more commodiously voided by
the <i>Mouth</i>, as already precautioned in <i>Chap.</i> 7.——</p>

<p class='c005'>THIS <i>Humour</i> being then thus prepared and discharg’d,
the <i>Breast</i> of some other clean and sound
<i>Woman</i> may be given the <i>CHILD</i>, until the <i>Mother’s
Milk</i> be purified for its proper <i>Use</i>; which it can
scarce be supposed to be, before the <i>Dissolution</i> of the
<i>MILK-FEVER</i>, that is before the <i>ninth day</i> after <i>DELIVERY</i>:
From which time, it is to be maintain’d
and nourish’d for the first three or four <i>Months</i> by
<i>BREAST-MILK</i> only; augmenting however its <i>Allowance</i>
from day to day, in proportion to its <i>Age</i> and
<i>Strength</i>, that the weak <i>Stomach</i> may never be overloaded,
so as to occasion <i>Vomiting</i>, or (which is worse)
a <i>DIARRHÆA</i>: To prevent which <i>Inconveniency</i>, let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>the <i>INFANT</i> rather <i>suck often</i>, and a <i>little at a Time</i>,
than too much at once.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AFTER</em> these first Months are over, a little thin
<i>PAP</i> may be given it every Morning, and in time
twice a day; which is commonly made of <i>Flower</i> and
<i>Milk</i>, or <i>Ale</i>, with a little <i>Sugar</i> and <i>Butter</i>: But because
<i>FLOWER</i> is of itself <i>humid</i> and <i>viscid</i>, and
may not only occasion <i>Pains</i> and <i>Obstructions</i>, but also,
engender <i>Gravel</i> and <i>Worms</i>, it ought to be first well
<i>dryed</i> in a new or clean earthen <i>Pot</i> in an <i>Oven</i>; or,
what is better, the <span class='sc'>Pap</span> may be made of the <i>Crumb</i> of a
Loaf: Which Diet is properly observ’d, until the
time of <i>Teething</i>, laying it still, a little after its <i>Meal</i>, to
rest upon its <i>Side</i>, or now and then upon its <i>Back</i>, with
the <i>Head</i> a little rais’d; however not in the <i>Bed</i> with
the <span class='sc'>Nurse</span>, for fear of overlaying it, but in a <span class='sc'>Cradle</span>
close by her <i>Bed-side</i>; always very carefully covering
the <span class='sc'>Child’s</span> <i>Face</i>, that the <i>Light</i> may not offend its tender
<i>Eyes</i>, and render them any ways <i>distorted</i> or <i>goggled</i>:
And as the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> may be brought up by the <i>Hand</i>
without <i>Suckling</i>, so it may easily be accustomed to
Sleep without <i>Rocking</i>. But be that as it will, as
soon as the <i>CHILD</i> is furnish’d with <span class='sc'>Teeth</span>, it is
proper by degrees to use it to a little more solid
<i>Food</i>, such as <i>Bread</i> and tender <i>Meats</i> or <i>Fleshes</i>, however,
a little chewed by the <i>NURSE</i>: In the mean time
no <i>Crude</i>, or <i>Meats</i> of hard <i>Digestion</i>, are to be allow’d
it, because <i>such</i> Things produce a <i>Corruption</i> of <i>Humours</i>,
whence <i>Worms</i> engender, and other various, grievous,
and irregular <i>Symptoms</i> arise.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> before I proceed farther, I ought to observe,
that the Duty of the Nurse does not consist entirely in
the abovesaid Conditions; for the <i>BABE</i> must be as duly
<i>washed</i> and <i>shifted</i>, <i>unswaddled</i> and <i>reswaddled</i> as <span class='sc'>Fed</span>:
Wherefore from the <span class='sc'>Birth</span>, until the third or fourth
<i>Month</i>, it ought to be <i>loosed</i> and <i>washed</i> all over in <i>warm
Water</i> twice or thrice a day, before the warm Fire; as
also in the night time if necessary, that the <i>Acrimony</i> of
the <i>Excrements</i> may not offend it: Upon which at every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>singular Occasion, the <span class='sc'>Nurse</span> may also <i>rub</i> its
tender Body gently, not only for the better <i>Concoction</i>
of its <i>Aliment</i>, but also for strengthening and consolidating
its <i>Members</i>; which Offices being all carefully
and affectionately done, the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> is to be
<i>shifted <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">toties quoties</span></i>, and orderly reswaddled in clean, dry
and warm <i>Clouts</i> and <i>Blankets</i>. However yet, from
the third Month until the <i>Teething-Time</i>, the Body
needs only be <i>washed once a day</i>, or (if you please) every
other day; as from thence forward it may only be <i>twice
a Week</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, when the <i>CHILD</i> begins to
use its <i>Hands</i> and <i>Feet</i>, if it moves briskly from place
to place, it is a good Sign of a strong and lively <i>Constitution</i>;
as it is the <i>Reverse</i>, when it sits torpidly or
drowsily still and unactive. Which notwithstanding,
these <i>brisk INFANTS</i> are not to be allow’d such <i>Motions</i>
too soon, I mean not to use their <i>Feet</i> prematurely or
too fast, as many ignorant Nurses commonly encourage
them to do: Because by these means, their tender Legs
may be easily distorted or become crooked. Whereas
when they are more firm and well-grown, they may
be learned to walk by the help of the <span class='sc'>Nurse’s</span> <i>Hand</i>,
or of a <i>Leading-String</i>; as afterwards they may be
inur’d to walk of themselves, by the means of a small
<i>Vehicle</i> or <i>Chariot</i>, as is generally well known in populous
Places.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the time of <i>Ablactation</i>, or weaning the
<i>CHILD</i> from the <i>Breast</i>, it is not always the same;
<i>some</i> being more robust and lively than <i>others</i>, and
consequently may be sooner <i>wean’d</i>; but <i>others</i> are
more weak and tender, and accordingly require longer
time of the <i>Breast</i>. However this be, the <span class='sc'>Infant</span> ought
not to be wean’d before it has its compleat <i>Sett of
Teeth</i>; <i>because</i> if sooner, it can no ways duly prepare its
<i>VICTUALS</i> by the <i>Mouth</i>, for <i>Concoction</i> in the <i>STOMACH</i>,
which may be of very bad Consequence;
Besides, in the time of <i>Teething</i>, especially about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span><i>Eruption</i> of those call’d the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Dog-Teeth</em></span>, the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> is subject to <i>Fevers</i>, Pains of the <i>Gums</i>, and
various other <i>Symptoms</i>, which would certainly be of
more <i>Danger</i> by far, if it was at that <i>Juncture</i> to be
deprived of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Breast</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>OTHERWAYS</em>, I take the due and proper Time
for <i>Weaning</i> the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>, to be about the 18th or
24th <i>Month</i>, rather longer than shorter; because it
surely finds the Benefit of this proper and benign <i>Aliment</i>
all the Days of its Life. Yet at what time soever
it happens to be done, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> is not on a sudden
to be accustomed to <i>different sorts</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Victuals</em></span>,
but rather, while it yet <i>Sucks</i>, to be gradually brought
to the <i>Use</i> of what is most convenient for its <i>Nutrition</i>,
such as <i>Hen</i> or <i>Chicken-Broth</i>, or the <i>Soup</i> of other
Meats, mix’d with a little <i>Crumb of Bread</i>; or a <i>Soup</i>
made of Ale, and <i>Crumbs</i>, with a little <i>Fresh-Butter</i>,
which is of excellent <i>Nourishment</i>: As before, or
about the Time that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span> is to be <i>Wean’d</i>,
a little half <i>chew’d Meat</i> of any Sort, provided <i>sweet</i>
and <i>fresh</i>, may be given it for a good <i>weaning
Repast</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> this Head, I shall only farther observe,
that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Ablactation</em></span>, or Weaning, always
happens more conveniently in the <i>Spring</i> or <i>Autumn</i>,
than in the <i>Summer</i> or <i>Winter</i>, and <i>that</i> more auspiciously
with the <i>encreasing</i> than with the <i>decreasing Moon</i>:
And <i>this</i>, because otherways, besides the <i>Alteration</i>
which happens to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> from the Change of
its <i>Diet</i> and <i>Aliment</i>, another may easily affect it from
the <i>Calidity</i> or <i>Frigidity</i> of the <i>Ambient Air</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> besides, in short, that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span> may
be the better and the more readily <i>Wean’d</i>, the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nurse’s</em></span> <i>Nipples</i> may be anointed with the fresh
<i>Juice of Wormwood</i>; or with a <i>Liniment</i> of the same
<i>Juice</i>, <i>Honey</i> and <i>Aloes</i>; or any other proper <i>Ingredients</i>,
discreetly us’d, that its tender <i>Lips</i> or <i>Gums</i>
may not be inflam’d, nor the weak <i>Stomach</i> hurt or offended.
However, the better way is, that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nurse</em></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>withdraw herself from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child’s</em></span> <i>Presence</i>; upon
which it is to be plentifully <i>fed</i>, as already advis’d,
allowing it a little <i>Ale</i>, but no <i>Wine</i>, for its Drink.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> as to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Diet</em></span> and <i>Regimen</i> of <i>Children</i>
from <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Ablactation</em></span> to the first <i>Seventh Year of
their Age</i>, I would farther observe, that it differs yet
altogether from that of more <i>adult Persons</i>, since their
infirm <i>Habits</i> and tender <i>Bodies</i> can no way tolerate,
or withstand the consequential <i>Effects</i> of an irregular
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Diet</em></span>, or an Erroneous <i>Regimen</i>: Besides this Age
requires <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Victuals</em></span> frequently, and <i>that</i> not only
what is sufficient for <i>Nutriment</i>, but also for <i>Growth</i>:
And moreover they ought still to be now and then
<i>bathed</i> or <i>washed</i> at Times.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> touching the <i>Affections</i> and <i>Passions</i> of
their Minds, great <i>Care</i> must be taken, that they be
not provoked to <i>Wrath</i> or <i>Anger</i>, nor frighted with
fearful <i>Notions</i> or <i>Phantasms</i>; since such Things make
strong <i>Impressions</i> upon their soft Bodies, and frequently
give <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Origin</em></span> to <i>Convulsions</i>, <i>Epilepsies</i>, &amp;c. However,
as <i>Children</i> are naturally more prone to <i>Evil</i> than
to <i>Good</i>, and to <i>Vice</i> rather than to <i>Virtue</i>, they are
not to be too much indulged; but from their <i>Infancy</i>
upwards, all such perverse <i>Faculties</i> and <i>Passions</i> of
Mind are to be so curbed and moderated, that they
may become subservient and obedient to <i>Reason</i>; and
<i>that</i> because this very <i>Age</i> is the proper Time to lay
the <i>Foundation</i> of their future good <i>Qualities</i> and <i>Disposition</i>,
agreeable to the <i>Rules</i> and <i>Præscripts</i> of a right
rational <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Oeconomy</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I know <i>This</i> is sometimes accounted a hard <i>Task</i>,
but if we consider that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Whelps</em></span> of Savage
<i>Bears</i> and <i>Lions</i> may be so tamed, as to obey the <i>Motions</i>
of their <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Keeper</em></span>, how much more easily may
the <i>Sons</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Men</em></span> be inur’d to follow the <i>Laws</i> of
right <i>Reason</i>? Their <i>Passion</i> first discover themselves
most commonly by <i>Crying</i> and <i>Tears</i>, tho’ sometimes
also otherways; wherefore such <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fits</em></span> of <i>Anger</i> or
<i>Passion</i> ought to be prudently reprehended in them;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>and when neither <i>Admonitions</i> nor <i>Commands</i> may
prevail, then <i>Threats</i> ought to take place, that all
<i>Frowardness</i> and <i>Obstinacy</i> may be stifled in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Bud</em></span>;
for the Mind of <i>Youth</i> may be justly compar’d to a
<i>Mass</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Wax</em></span> or <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Clay</em></span>, on which we may readily
<i>stamp</i> what <i>Impression</i> we please to make.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> these <i>Reasons</i>, their <i>Attendants</i>, or such other
Persons as may be occasionally about <i>Children</i>, ought
carefully to avoid <i>doing</i> or <i>saying</i> any <i>mean</i>, <i>base</i> or
<i>vile Thing</i>, especially in their Presence or to their
Knowledge; since here the <i>old Proverb</i> holds most
true, that, <i>we are drawn by Precept, but led by Example</i>.
Wherefore to moderate and mitigate their <i>Passions</i>,
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children</em></span> ought to be allowed proper <i>Diversions</i>,
and such <i>Exercises</i> of Body as their <i>Age</i> and <i>Constitution</i>
will permit; and <i>that</i> also, because if they were
to be brought up lazily or sluggishly, without <i>Motion</i>
or <i>Exercise</i>, their <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Victuals</em></span> which is now commonly
given them both plentifully and frequently,
could not possibly <i>disperse</i> itself nor <i>digest</i>, upon which
the <i>innate Heat</i> would infallibly suffer a sensible
<i>Decay</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> Things being duly observed, it now only
farther remains, that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> be well train’d up,
and carefully educated; instilling all along into its
Mind the <i>Principles</i> of <i>Humanity</i> and <i>Morality</i>, and
instructing it gradually in the Knowledge of <i>Arts</i> and
<i>Sciences</i>; which it will even at this tender Age be
found capable of Conceiving: For the <i>Human Mind</i>
being naturally adapted to attain to the <i>Cognition</i> of
all sublunary Things, may be thus endued and furnished
with the most laudable <i>Arts</i>, before it can
distinguish the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Use</em></span> of them; since according to the
<i>Philosopher</i>’s wise saying<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c017'><sup>[185]</sup></a>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nostrum scire nihil aliud est,
quam Reminsisci</span></i>. Because (I say) the <i>Mind of Man</i>
perceives and comprehends the Notion and Knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>of all temporal Things in it self, notwithstanding that
it cannot easily display it self, by reason of the burthensome
Oppression of the <i>Body</i> and its gross <i>Humours</i>:
Like as a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fire</em></span>, overlaid with <i>Ashes</i>, must be raised
up and fomented, before its engender’d or retain’d
<i>Sparkles</i> can exert themselves with any <i>Lustre</i>; so it is
even with us, before the <i>Light</i> and <i>Instinct</i> of our Natures
can shine forth: For as some <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Roots</em></span> cast no
<i>Smell</i>, or breathe no <i>Fragrancy</i> of themselves, unless
they be softly touched or squeezed with the <i>Hand</i>;
so neither do our <i>Natural Powers</i> and <i>Faculties</i> exert or
show themselves, unless they be diligently exercised
and cultivated.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> we have now guided and conducted the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> from its <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>, to the <i>Seventh Year of his
Age</i>; which being only meant by the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>,
that was safely <i>Born</i>, and continued all along in
<i>Health</i>; I come now in the next place, to hint upon
what is farther <i>Requisite</i> towards the <i>rearing of such</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children</em></span>, whole <i>Misfortune</i> it may be, either to
come into the World with <i>Infirmities</i>, or to be afterwards
subjected to them in their <i>Cradles</i>. And <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span>,</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> X.</span><br /> <i>Of the various Symptoms and Indispositions wherewith the</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> <i>may be Born.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>SINCE</em> <i>some</i> only, not <i>all</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children</em></span>, happen
to bring <i>Infirmities</i> with them into the World;
and because such <i>Indispositions</i> as are chiefly meant
here, discover themselves presently at the Time of
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>, and require immediate <i>Cure</i>; I shall concisely
enter upon, and briefly comprehend them All here,
as they most commonly fall out, in this present
<i>Chapter</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> order to which, I shall previously observe, that
such <i>Inconveniencies</i> happening to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>, may
have a double <i>Origin</i>, and proceed either from a <i>Defect</i>
in Nature, or the <i>Effect</i> of a difficult <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>:
The <i>First</i> may take Rise from various Causes, such as of
the <i>Parental Seed</i>, the <i>Forming Faculty</i>, the <i>Maternal</i> or
<i>Uterine Constitution</i>, an <i>illegitimate Time</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>,
and the like; as the <i>Latter</i> may also arrive, not only
from a <i>Difficult</i>, or <i>Preternatural</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Labour</em></span>, <i>&amp;c.</i> but also
from the ignorant, rough Usage, or barbarous Treatment
of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Midwife</em></span>. However, not to insist too
long on these Things, it very often, and too commonly
happens.</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em>, The <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> suffers so much in the
<i>Birth</i>, that (when born) it is hard to know, whether
it be <i>dead</i> or <i>alive</i>, not one part of the Body being
perceiv’d to <i>move</i>; which however may be <i>thus</i> well
known, <i>viz.</i> by laying my <i>Hand</i> upon its <i>Breast</i>, I
shall feel the Motion of the <i>Heart</i>, if alive, tho’ never
so weak; as I shall also perceive a small <i>Pulsation</i> of
the <i>Arteries</i>, by touching the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Navel-String</em></span> near
the <i>Belly</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> which <i>Case</i>, I would immediately order the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span> to be laid in a <i>Warm Bed</i> or <i>Blanket</i>, and
quickly carried to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fire</em></span>; where its <i>Mouth</i> is to
be open’d, as its <i>Nose</i> is to be clean’d and unstopp’d
with small <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Tents</em></span> dipp’d in warm <i>White-Wine</i>, and
<i>Linnen</i> wet with the same applied to its <i>Breast</i> and
<i>Belly</i>; spurting always in the mean time, a little of
the same <i>Wine</i> into its <i>Mouth</i> and <i>Nose</i>, until it begin
to stir: Or then I would distil a drop of <i>Aqua-Vitæ</i>,
from time to time upon its <i>Tongue</i>, bathing its <i>Pulses</i>
and <i>Nostrils</i> with the same, while I anointed its <i>Mouth</i>
with <i>Honey</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> sometimes only happens, that the tender
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Face</span></em> is bruised <i>Black</i> or <i>Blew</i>, <i>Pale</i> or <i>Livid</i>;
which may also as well proceed from the Bones of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pelvis</em></span>, or from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child’s</em></span> being Born <i>Face-upwards</i>,
as from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Midwife’s</em></span> hard Usage. In
this <i>Condition</i>, I would only order it to be frequently
anointed with the <i>Oil of Sweet Almonds</i>, drawn without
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fire</em></span>, that is, by Expression; upon which it soon
recovers its <i>Natural Colour</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>AGAIN</em> sometimes the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span> is born
with a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Knob</em></span> or <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Tumour</em></span> on the <i>Crown of its
Head</i>, occasion’d by its hard <i>Pressure</i> against the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Orifice</em></span>, or by its strict <i>Compression</i> in the same:
In which <i>Condition</i>, I would immediately foment it with
<i>warm Wine</i> or <i>Aqua-Vitæ</i>, and apply a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Compress</em></span>
to it, either wet in the <i>same</i>, or in the <i>Oil of Roses</i>
and <i>Wine</i> beat together; and the same <i>Fomentation</i>
and <i>Compress</i> may serve for any other Part of the Body,
which may be swell’d by <i>rough Usage</i>, or otherways,
in a <i>difficult</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>. But in <i>Case</i> of <i>Suppuration</i>, it
must be open’d in a proper place with a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lancet</em></span>,
applying afterwards a <i><em class='gesperrt'>Plaister</em></i> of <i>Betony</i>. As
also in <i>Case</i> of a <i>Fracture</i>, or any sort of <i>Dislocation</i>,
the <i>Parts</i> must be join’d and reunited, and duly retain’d
in their <i>Natural Position</i> by convenient <i>Boulsters</i>
or <i>Splinters</i>, until they be firmly closed and reconjoin’d.
Moreover</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> <i>Difficult</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Births</em></span>, it very commonly falls
out that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Head</em></span> is pressed into an <i>oblong Form</i>
by the <i>Bones</i> of the <i>Pelvis</i>, because the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Scull</em></span> not
being made of one piece, is not equally <i>hard</i> or <i>firm</i>;
the <i>Sutures</i> being only surrounded with <i>Membranes</i>,
especially the <i>Top</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Head</em></span> is so <i>Membranous</i> and
soft, that the <i>Bones</i> forming the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Scull</em></span> may be
easily pressed one upon another; from whence we
have this <i>oblong Figure</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Head</em></span>. However, in
short, this may be corrected and reduced to its <i>Natural
Shape</i>, by frequent, but cautious and skilful, <i>Handling</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>WEAK</em> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children</em></span>, and such as come
<i>præmaturely</i>, or before their Time, into the World,
have the <i>Mould</i> and <i>Sutures</i> very open, and the <i>Bones</i>
far distant: In which Condition they are only to be
softly bound about with a small <i>Cross-Cloth</i>, committing
the rest to <i>Nature</i>; which in time, and by degrees,
will close up and consolidate these <i>Sutures</i>; and sooner
or later, according to the <i>innate Heat</i> and <i>Moisture</i> of
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>, unite and join the <i>Bones</i> of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Head</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>SOMETIMES</em> also it happens that the
Child is <i>Tongue-ty’d</i>, by the too strait <i>Astriction</i> of
its <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Bridle</em></span>; so that this <i>Member</i> cannot freely extend
or move itself, thro’ the <i>Capacity</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mouth</em></span>;
which in the <i>Infancy</i> impedes or hinders its <i>Sucking</i>,
as in riper Years it does the <i>Faculty</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Speaking</em></span>:
In this <i>Case</i>, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Tongue</em></span>, being supported or held
up, on each side of the String, by a small forked <i>Instrument</i>,
ought to be <i>cut a-cross</i> by sharp <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Scissors</em></span> as
much as is needful; which however must be done with
Caution, not to hurt the <i>Veins</i> under the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Tongue</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VII. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span> is also sometimes troubled
with a small round <i>Tumour</i> under the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Tongue</em></span>,
fill’d with <i>vitious Blood</i>, or <i>pituitous Matter</i>; which
<i>Aëtius</i> and <i>Paulus Ægineta</i> call’d <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Ranula Linguæ</em></span>;
Which <i>Case</i> may be managed, and the <i>Tumour</i> dissolved
by a little <i>Ammoniac Salt</i>, or such other proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span><i>Remedies</i>; but if Occasion require, the same may be
open’d by a <i>Lancet</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> also happens, tho’ but seldom, that the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> is born with a close <i>Fundament</i>; and <i>that</i>
sometimes shut up by the single <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Skin</em></span>, and sometimes
by a <i>fleshy Substance</i>: In the first <i>Condition</i>,
there appear some <i>livid Marks</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Meconium</em></span>
thro’ the <i>Skin</i>, which feels soft to the <i>Touch</i>. Upon
which occasion, an <i>Apertion</i> must be made with a
small <i>Incision-Knife</i>, a-cross, not long-ways, that it
may the better receive a <i>round Form</i>, and not so easily
grow again together; which however must be done
with great Caution, that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sphincter</em></span> of the
<i>Rectum</i> may not be hurt: And the <i>Meconium</i> being
afterwards voided, whether by a <i>Suppository</i>, <i>Clyster</i>,
or otherways; the <i>Orifice</i> is to be stopp’d up with a
<i>Linnen-Tent</i>, anointed at the beginning with <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Rose-Honey</em></span>,
but afterwards with some drying and cicatrizing
<i>Ointment</i>, such as <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Unguentum-Aleum</em></span>,
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pompholyx</em></span>, <i>&amp;c.</i> Dressing it always as
often, and as soon, as the <i>Excrements</i> are evacuated,
lest the <i>Apertion</i> should turn to an <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Ulcer</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in the other <i>Case</i>, where the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fundament</em></span>
is stopped up with <i>Flesh</i>, that neither any
Mark nor Appearance of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Rectum</em></span> is seen or
felt, whereby its true <i>Situation</i> may be known, or
the proper place where the <i>Aperture</i> ought to be
made; The <i>Operation</i> is much more difficult, and the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span> but seldom escapes the fatal Consequence
of this <i>Misfortune</i>: Which Difficulty notwithstanding,
we are diligently to do our Best upon such Occasions;
to which End, an <i>Apertion</i> must be made
within <i>half</i> an Inch of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child’s</em></span> <i>Rump</i>, being
the certain place of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Rectum</em></span>; which in the
<i>interim</i> must be perform’d with the greatest Care and
Judgment by a small <i>Incision-Knife</i> with one Edge,
turning the <i>Back upwards</i>, and thrusting it so forward,
until the <i>Aperture</i> be made big enough for the
<i>Excrements</i> to pass thro’, always prudently regarding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sphincter</em></span> as above; upon which the
<i>Wound</i>, &amp;c. are to be dressed and order’d, as in the
preceding <i>Case</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IX. <em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> like manner, it also may happen that the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span> is born with its <i>Urinary Passage</i> shut up;
upon which Occasion, a convenient <i>Apertion</i> must
also be made with a proper <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lancet</em></span>: Which <i>Operation</i>
must likewise be perform’d with great Prudence
and Ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c005'>X. <em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, It also sometimes falls out,
that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> is infected with the <i>Venereal Lues</i>,
from the Predominancy of that <i>Distemper</i> in the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mother</em></span>; <i>which</i> Case easily discovers itself by
many <i>Pustules</i> and <i>Ulcers</i> appearing at the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span> in
diverse Parts of its Body, especially about the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Head</em></span>,
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Belly</em></span>, <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Thighs</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Clunes</em></span>: Upon which
the <i>Cure</i> may be pertinently protracted to a more advanced
Age, tho’ prudent <i>Measures</i> may be taken, to
keep the <i>Distemper under</i>, but if the <i>Condition</i> be
Malignant, the <i>Remedy</i> is commonly prevented by
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Death</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>XI. <em class='gesperrt'>FINALLY</em> as to the small or puny <i>Faults</i> of
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nature</em></span>, such as a distorted or wry <i><em class='gesperrt'>Mouth</em></i>,
crooked or flat <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nose</em></span>, thick or flabby <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lips</em></span>, rough
or ugly <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Visage</em></span>, or the like <i>Blemishes</i>,——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child’s</em></span> <i>Body</i> being tractable like a piece
of <i>Wax</i>, or the <i>Potter’s Clay</i>, These may be Judiciously
corrected and Ingeniously amended, and a more Delectable
and Amiable <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Form</em></span> given to<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c017'><sup>[186]</sup></a> every <i>Part</i>;
as in <i>Case</i> of any <i>Blemish</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Eyes</em></span>, whether
they be Discoloured, or Sparkling, Dim or Short-sighted,
Squint or Goggle, Rolling or Goat-eyed; a
Lovely <i>black Colour</i>, and a <i>graceful Beauty</i>, may be
also artfully given them<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c017'><sup>[187]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> (I think) These are all the most common
<i>Symptoms</i> or <i>Indispositions</i> which the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> brings
with it into the World; which being thus briefly
discuss’d, I come at length to——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XI.</span><br /> <i>Of the Sundry Symptoms and Diseases, peculiarly incident to the</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span> <i>after its</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>NOTWITHSTANDING</em> that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span>
may be born free from all apparent <i>Symptoms</i> of
any <i>Indisposition</i>, and however careful the Honest
Nurse may be of its <i>Diet</i> and <i>Regimen</i>; yet it
seldom happens, but it undergoes some one or more
of the <i>following subitaneous Inconveniencies</i>, viz.——</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Gripes</em></span> or <i>Pains</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Belly</em></span>, which
may proceed either from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Meconium</em></span>, its not
being timely, or not fully evacuated; or from the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nurse’s</em></span> <i>Milk</i>, its generating <i>Wind</i> and <i>acid Humours</i>,
either by her using improper flatulent <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Food</em></span>,
or from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Babe’s</em></span> sucking more <i>Milk</i> than its
<i>Stomach</i> can digest: Or the same <i>Pains</i> and <i>Gripes</i>
may also proceed from the <i>Effects</i> of cold <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Air</em></span>, or
from <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Worms</em></span> in the <i>Intestines</i>, or from the <i>unseasonable
use</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pap</em></span>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> Affection in general is known by the <i>Inquietude</i>
and <i>Crying</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>, which is now
(in a manner) averse to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Breast</em></span>, continually
turning itself here and there, without Rest or Intermission
of <i>Pain</i>; But more particularly, <i>This</i> proceeding
from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Meconium</em></span>, may be distinguished and
known by the <i>Colour</i> of the <i>Excrements</i>, since the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Meconium</em></span> is always <i>black</i>, and as soon as it is
altogether voided, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stool</em></span> becomes <i>pale</i>; and
<i>that</i> may be readily cured by the means already prescribed<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c017'><sup>[188]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>If this <i>Affection</i> proceeds from <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Wind</em></span>,
it may be known by the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child’s</em></span> frequently <i>belching</i>
and the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Belly’s</span></em> <i>swelling</i>, if from <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Cold</em></span>,
the <i>use</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pap</em></span>, or from any <i>pituitous viscid Humour</i>,
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Belly</em></span> is most commonly <i>bound</i>, and the <i>Cure</i>
differs but little from the preceeding <i>Case</i>. If from
corrupted <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Milk</em></span> or <i>acid Humours</i>, the <i>Condition</i> is
most commonly attended with a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Diarrhæa</em></span>, and
the <i>Excrements</i> are of a greenish or <i>Saffron Colour</i>:
The <i>Cure</i> of which, depends upon proper <i>Abstergents</i>
and Evacuations. If at last from <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Worms</em></span>, their
proper <i>Diagnosticks</i> shew it, of which in their Place.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>SOMETIMES</em> an <i>Extension</i> or shooting
forth of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Navel</em></span> happens to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span>,
and that frequently to the Bigness of an <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Egg</em></span>, more
or less; which <i>Case</i> is properly call’d an <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Exomphalon</em></span>,
and proceeds either from the continual
<i>Cries</i>, or violent <i>Coughs</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>, or from a
<i>Laxation</i> or <i>Rupture</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Peritonæum</em></span>, or
sometimes from an <i>Exulceration</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Navel</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> this <i>Condition</i>, whatever the <i>Cause</i> may be, the
sooner that the <i>Cure</i> is undertaken, the more easily it
is perform’d; for which End, after removing the
Causes of <i>Crying</i> or <i>Coughing</i>, the relaxed <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Peritonæum</em></span>
may be strengthened and astringed; as when
bursten, it may be reunited and consolidated by proper
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Cataplasms</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Swaths</em></span>; after replacing
the <i>Intestines</i> (if fallen down) keeping the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span>
for the most part in <i>Bed</i>, with its <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Belly</em></span> always
<i>loose</i>, and never <i>too full</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> the same is the Method of <i>Cure</i>, in <i>Case</i>
of an <i>Intestinal</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Rupture</em></span>, otherwise call’d <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Enterocele</em></span>,
i. e. <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hernia</em></span>; only, That a <i>Truss</i>
is now more convenient than a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Swath</em></span>: However
in this Place I would observe that all <i>Tumours</i> of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Scrotum</em></span>, are not to be mistaken for the present
<i>Bursten Case</i>; because the same may also happen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>from a <i>Watry Humour</i> collected in that Part, which
is more properly call’d an <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hydrocele</em></span>, and is
easily distinguish’d from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Enterocele</em></span>: Insomuch,
that, in this <i>Condition</i> the <i>Tumour</i> is most commonly,
in one part of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Scrotum</em></span>, I mean in its
<i>Right</i> or <i>Left Side</i>; when also the fallen <i>Intestines</i> may
be perceiv’d by the <i>Touch</i>; as the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Rupture</em></span> or
<i>Hole</i> through which the <i>Intestines</i> are fallen, may be
by the <i>Finger</i>: Whereas in the <i>Case</i> of an <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hydrocele</em></span>,
the <i>Tumour</i> is commonly in <i>both Sides</i>,
and the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Scrotum</em></span> is more puffed up, neither is
there any <i>Hole</i> of a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Rupture</em></span> to be found in the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Peritonæum</em></span>. The <i>Cure</i> of which <i>Case</i> depends
entirely upon proper <i>Absorbents</i>, or <i>Discutients</i>, for resolving
and drying up the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Water</em></span>, or dissipating
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Wind</em></span>, and afterwards upon <i>Corroboratives</i> for
confirming the <i>Parts</i>. But after All, in the mean
Time this <i>Tumour</i> is also sometimes, upon occasion,
properly open’d by a <span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>LANCET</em></span> to evacuate its <i>preternatural
Contents</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. <em class='gesperrt'>AN</em> <i>Inflammation</i> or <i>Exulceration</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Navel</em></span>
may happen to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span>, by the <i>String’s</i>
falling off too soon, or before it be fully clos’d and
<i>cicatriz’d</i>; which may proceed from any violent
Agitation of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Belly</em></span>, by continual <i>Crying</i>, vehement
<i>Coughing</i>, &amp;c. as it also may from an unskilful
<i>Ligature</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>String</em></span>, or from cold <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Air</em></span>; upon
which sometimes follows a great loss of <i>Blood</i>, and even
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Death</em></span> itself, if not timely prevented.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Inflammation</i> is known by the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Navel’s</em></span>
swelling-up, being red and hard with <i>Heat</i> and <i>Pulsation</i>;
In which <i>Case</i> after appeasing the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant’s</em></span>
<i>Coughs</i>, or <i>Cries</i>, &amp;c.—I would apply to it the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unguentum
refrigerans Galeni &amp; Populeon</span></i>, each one half
mix’d; or a small <i>Bolster</i> dip’d in the <i>Oil of Roses</i> with
a little <i>Vinegar</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em>, and if the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Navel</em></span> continues <i>Ulcer’d</i>
after the falling of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>String</em></span> from it; in that
<i>Case</i> proper <i>Desiccative</i> and <i>Astringent Medicines</i> are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>to be apply’d, such as small <i>Rags</i> dipp’d in <i>Lime-Water</i>,
but not too strong; or in <i>Plantane-Water</i>, wherein a
little <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Alum</em></span> has been dissolved. If the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Ulcer</em></span>
be but small, a <i>Pledget</i> of <i>Dry Lint</i> will be sufficient;
observing always to keep a good <i>Linnen Compress</i> on
the <i>Top</i> of whatsoever <i>Remedy</i> is us’d, with a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Swath</em></span>
to keep all fast, until the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Navel</em></span> be perfectly heal’d
and <i>cicatriz’d</i>; lest at the same time it should also
force itself <i>outwards</i>, as in the ’foregoing <i>Case</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. <em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Child</i> is also very frequently troubled with
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Aphthæ</em></span>, or <i>Ulcers of the Mouth</i>; commonly
call’d the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Thrush</em></span>: Proceeding either from vitious
<i>Milk</i>, or from its <i>Corruption</i>, in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stomach</em></span>;
emitting sharp <i>Vapours</i>, which readily affect the tender
Skin and Superfice of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant’s</em></span> <i>Mouth</i>, and
<i>that</i> the more easily, because the same <i>Tunick</i>, or <i>Skin</i>,
which invests the <i>Mouth</i>, is common to the <i>Gullet</i>,
which naturally communicates the <i>Affections</i> of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Ventricle</em></span> to the <i>Jaws</i>. Hence it is that the
<i>Nice Taste</i> of the <i>delicate</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Tongue</em></span> so readily distinguishes
all <i>Relishes</i>; and hence it is that the Ingenious
<i>Physician</i>, by looking upon the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Tongue</em></span> only,
is able to judge of the prevailing <i>Intemperament</i> of the
whole Body.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cure</i> of these <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Thrushes</em></span>, proceeding
as aforesaid from the <i>acid Vapours</i> of bad <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Milk</em></span>, or
from its ill <i>Digestion</i>, depends properly and entirely upon
defeating and obtunding the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Acrimony</em></span>, by
<i>proper Absorbents</i>, and gentle <i>Purgatives</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>VI. <em class='gesperrt'>ANOTHER</em> <i>Symptom</i> not only familiar, but
even <i>Natural</i>, to all <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children</em></span>, is their <i>Teething</i>;
which tho’ <i>This</i> be the mere Work of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nature</em></span>, yet
because of the various <i>Distempers</i> and <i>Symptoms</i>, which
commonly attend and conjoin this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Dentition</em></span>, it is
not improperly reckon’d in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Category</em></span> of the
<i>Diseases</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infants</em></span>: Which however is to be
understood, not of the <i>Simple</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Dentition</em></span>, but of
the difficult <i>Breeding of Teeth</i>; Not but that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span><span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> is furnished with <i>Teeth</i> even before <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>,
tho’ they lurk so long in their proper <i>Sockets</i>, being
cover’d with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Gums</em></span>, until their due Time of
<i>Eruption</i><a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c017'><sup>[189]</sup></a>. Tho’ in the <i>Interim</i>, it has been observed
that some <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children</em></span> have brought eminent <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Teeth</em></span>
with them into the World<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c017'><sup>[190]</sup></a>, as it is also for <i>Instance</i>,
particularly reported of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lewis</em></span> the XIV of <i>France</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> however the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Teeth</em></span> most commonly break
out about the <i>Seventh Month</i>, and first those call’d
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dentes Incisores</span></i>, or the <i>four</i> fore-<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Teeth</em></span>; which
after a short <i>Interval</i>, are followed by the <i>two</i> <i>Dog-Teeth</i>,
commonly call’d the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Eye-Teeth</em></span>; and at
last succeeded by the eight <i>Cheek-Teeth</i> or <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Grinders</em></span>,
in each Jaw; the two last of the <i>Molares</i>, properly
called <i>Dentes Sapientiæ</i>, springing only out about, or
after the one and twentieth Year. Now as this
<i>Eruption</i>, particularly <i>that</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Dog-Teeth</em></span>,
because of their very deep <i>Root</i> and small <i>Nerve</i>,
cannot happen without an <i>exquisite Sense</i>, and <i>intense
Pain</i> to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>; so, from the continual
<i>Solution</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Gums</em></span>, many præternatural <i>Affections</i>
seize the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span>, according to <i>Hippocrates’s</i> Catalogue<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c017'><sup>[191]</sup></a>;
to which, in short, I must only refer: Because
if I was to enter upon the particular <i>Detail</i> of all
<i>These</i>, I should extend the <i>Limits</i> of this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Work</em></span>
beyond all measure; wherefore I shall endeavour to
comprehend them all under the <i>one following general

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> XII.</span><br /> <i>Of the Acute Diseases of</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Infants</span></em>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> very tender <i>Nature</i> and infirm <i>Constitution</i>
of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children</em></span>, subject them to many various
and grievous <i>Symptoms</i>, besides those to which they
are expos’d by a vast variety of <i>Procatarctick Causes</i>.
But as I am not in this place to enter upon the <i>Detail</i>
of these particular <i>Symptoms</i>, neither shall I enumerate
their respective <i>Causes</i>: Which however is the less
requisite, considering the <i>Regimen</i> and <i>Nursement</i> of
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> already prescribed in the foregoing <i>Chapters</i>;
since the <i>least step</i>, degenerating from what is
there inculcated, may prove an effectual <i>mediate Cause</i>;
for all that indeed, according to the most Learned
and Excellent Dr. <i>Harris</i>, the only <i>immediate Cause</i> of all
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children’s</em></span> <i>Diseases</i> is, an <i>Active</i> and <i>prevailing</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Acid</em></span><a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c017'><sup>[192]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Doctrine</i>, in as much as the <i>Constitution</i> of
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infants</em></span> is undeniably most <i>Humid</i>, appears also
evident from <i>Hippocrates</i>’s his own Words, saying,
<i>the Rise of all Diseases is one and the same, the Place
only makes the Difference</i><a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c017'><sup>[193]</sup></a>. Hence we may justly conclude,
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span>, <i>That</i>, however the <i>Symptoms</i> may
differ in <i>degree</i>, the <i>Diseases</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>-<i>State</i>
are but very <i>few</i>: <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Secondly</em></span>, That the <i>Cure</i> of
<i>these</i> is far more Safe and Easy, than <i>those</i> of full
<i>grown Persons</i>: <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Thirdly</em></span>, That the <i>Younger</i> the
<i>Sick</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> is, the more easy still is the <i>Cure</i>:
Because its tender Body, abounding with <i>Natural</i> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span><i>acquired Moisture</i>, is soft and flexile, and consequently apt
to receive any <i>Alteration</i>: And <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fourthly</em></span>, I observe
that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span> easily falls into <i>Sickness</i>, or may be
suddenly taken Ill, and as readily restored to <i>Health</i>,
if but carefully and ingenuously <i>treated</i>: Because any
<i>Impression</i> whatsoever, good or bad, is sooner received
by a <i>Soft</i>, than by a <i>Hard Body</i>; tho’, I confess, the
same is more <i>Lasting</i>, if once strongly impressed upon
the <i>Hard adult Constitution</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> as to the <i>Diagnosticks</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children’s</em></span>
<i>Diseases</i>, These depend chiefly upon the <i>Relation</i> of
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nurses</em></span>; since all <i>Sentiments</i> taken from their
unruly <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pulses</em></span>, or their (naturally) thick <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Urines</em></span>,
prove most <i>Uncertain</i>. However, as the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stomach</em></span>
is always affected with an <i>Acid Distemper</i>, (whatever
the reigning <i>Disease</i> may be, or howsoever it may be
intitled by ingenious <i>Authors</i>) so it most commonly
produces <i>Fastidy</i> or <i>Loathing</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Victuals</em></span>, <i>Vomiting</i>
of a thick <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Gelly</em></span>, or a viscid and coagulated
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Phlegm</em></span>, sour <i>Belchings</i>, and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Excrements</em></span>
of a sourish <i>Smell</i>, and a greenish <i>Colour</i>, especially in
the Beginning. As afterwards——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> the <i>Distemper</i> continues, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span> turns
gradually <i>Pale</i>, and its discoloured <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Face</em></span> is tinged a
little <i>Green</i> or <i>Yellowish</i>; The <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Belly</em></span> swells with
<i>Wind</i>, which breaks frequently <i>upwards</i>; one or more red
<i>Pustules</i> (a certain sign of <i>Acidity</i>) commonly rise in
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Face</em></span>, or upon some other <i>upper Part</i> of the
Body; and the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span> growing daily worse, <i>breathes
high</i>, and <i>smells sour</i> or <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Acid</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Again</em></span>, As to the <i>Prognosticks</i> of these <i>Distempers</i>,
of what kind soever they be, which afflict the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>;
I cannot in short, but readily agree with the
most Ingenious <i>Doctor</i> before-mentioned, who plainly
tells us, that <i>These</i> depend chiefly upon the Method
of <i>Cure</i>, and the <i>Conduct</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nurse</em></span>; Wherefore
I proceed to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Cure</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to this point then of the <i>Cure</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children’s</em></span>
<i>Diseases</i>, I shall <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span> observe that, how
<i>many</i> soever these <i>Distempers</i> are accounted, according
to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Registers</em></span> of <i>Polite Authors</i>, by what
Name soever they are denominated, and how learnedly
soever defin’d, as they all proceed from one immediate
<i>efficient Cause</i>, (which has been already hinted
at) so the <i>Cure</i> of them all is the same, and depends,
in like manner, upon <i>One only regular Method</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, I observe that as this <i>Cause</i> is
nothing else than an <i>Acid Humour</i>, abounding in the
<i>Stomach</i>, and coagulating the <i>imbib’d Nourishment</i> of
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>, (as is evident from all the given <i>Diagnosticks</i>)
so the proper <i>Method of Cure</i>, depends entirely
upon obtunding that <i>Acidity</i>, dissolving those
<i>Coagulations</i>, and eliminating the <i>peccant Matter</i>. But
more particularly,</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HAVING</em> always a great and due regard to the
<i>natural Debility</i>, and <i>tender Constitution</i> of the <i>Young</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span>, the <i>Acid</i> ought first to be prepared by
prudent means, and then to be carried off by proper
<i>Medicines</i>. I say <i>prepared</i> by prudent Means, because
<i>this</i> is no indifferent Matter; For if we should take
the same Method with these tender <i>Creatures</i> in this
<i>Case</i>, that we do with more <i>adult Persons</i> we would
certainly <i>miscarry</i> in our Attempts; or if we should
attempt this Preparation, by <i>Alexipharmacks</i>, <i>Cordials</i>,
(improperly so call’d) <i>Causticks</i>, or <i>Sudorificks</i>; these
Things being most prejudicial to the Nature of <i>young</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Ones</em></span>, would rather promote the <i>Crudity</i>, than the
<i>Concoction</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Humours</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THEREFORE</em> the ingenious Doctrine of the
Excellent Doctor <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Harris</em></span>, must certainly take
place here, namely<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c017'><sup>[194]</sup></a>,that <i>the most temperate Things
most securely absorb the prevailing Acidity, and that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>more Simple and Gentle the Remedies are, the more Safe
and Certain the Cure is.</i></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> the simple <i>Testaceous Medicines</i> mentioned by
him, are not to be paralleled in the present <i>Case</i>; since they
effectually mitigate all <i>Ebullitions</i>, and gradually become
the most safe and powerful <i>Anodines</i>: Insomuch, that
they, in a word, as certainly asswage all the <i>Pains</i>,
<i>Gripes</i>, <i>Disquiets</i>, <i>Watchings</i>, &amp;c. of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children</em></span>;
as <i>Narcoticks</i>, or <i>Opiats</i>, do allay those of older
People.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> Body being then alter’d by these means, and
the <i>Humours</i> duly prepared, they are to be forthwith
ejected, or timely purged off, even from the <i>youngest</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infants</em></span>, as well as from those of riper Years:
The <i>Doses</i> and <i>Quantities</i> of all sorts, being discreetly
adapted to the <i>Age</i> and <i>Strength</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span>,
under what <i>Form</i> soever they may be given.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> this Head, I might indeed pretend to expatiate,
but because, whatever <i>I</i>, or any <i>other ingenuous
Person</i>, understanding the Matter in Hand, may attempt
to offer, will only terminate in, and be consentaneous
to, what my last quoted <i>Author</i> has plainly
laid down, and concisely comprehended in a few <i>emphatick
Words</i>; I shall here also, for Brevity’s-sake, set
Bounds to my <i>Progress</i>. And thus, in short, having
at large, and in every particular Respect, faithfully discharged
my <i>Duty</i>, both as <i>Physician</i> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Midwife</em></span>,
to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> as well as to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mother</em></span>;
I now take leave of both the <i>one</i> and the
<i>other</i>, and in the next place, come briefly to touch
upon the <i>Reverse Cases</i>.</p>

<em class='gesperrt'>HAVING</em> particularly defin’d the <i>Natural

and hitherto treated of its various different

<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child-Bed</em></span>;
I come in the next place (conformable
to my promise before-mentioned) to treat of the opposite
and <i>reverse Case</i>, commonly call’d (by the
<i>Authors</i>) a vitious or depravated <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>:
Which however, I shall distinguish by the general
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Title</em></span> of <i>præternatural</i>, as I have one <i>Set</i> of
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Births</em></span> under the same Denomination, contained
in Sect. V. But——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em>, because I judge all such <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conceptions</em></span>
as well as <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Births</em></span>, to be <i>præternatural</i>, which,
tho’ not according to the <i>ordinary Institution</i> of

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> II.</span><br /> <i>Of</i> <span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>SUPERFÆTATIONS</em></span>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>A <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Superfætation</em></span> is nothing else than a
<i>Second</i> (after a <i>First</i>) <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>:
Since if divers <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infants</em></span> may be <i>conceiv’d</i> at
one <i>Embrace</i>, as will evidently appear from the following
<i>Chapter</i>, we may easily believe, that <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, or
<i>more Embraces</i>, may most probably have the same <i>Effect</i>:
Which is sufficiently confirm’d by the Experience of
<i>Hippocrates</i><a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c017'><sup>[195]</sup></a> himself, as well as by many other most
Learned <i>Authors</i><a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c017'><sup>[196]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em> I shall spend no time in reciting
here any <i>Instances</i> I have met with of this <i>Nature</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>only I refer the <i>Curious</i> to a very famous collected
<i>History</i> of such <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Births</em></span>, as in the <i>Margin</i><a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c017'><sup>[197]</sup></a>.
Whence the Certainty of <i>Superfætation</i> is not to be
doubted, and much less to be disputed: And according
to <i>Aristotle</i> the same may happen, after the
<i>Second</i> or <i>Third Day</i>, from first Conception, as well as
after so many <i>Months</i><a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c017'><sup>[198]</sup></a>. But farther,——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cause</i> of all <i>Superfætations</i> is only an <i>Apertion</i>
of the <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, at the Effusion
of the <i>Virile</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span>. Which however (according to
<i>Avicen</i>) only happens to such <i>Women</i>, as have plenty
of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span>, or a <i>Calid</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, desirous of <i>Copulation</i>,
or to such as have their <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Menstrua</em></span> after the <i>first</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SUPERFÆTATIONS</em> however are not easily
discover’d before <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>; at which time, <i>Avicen</i> advises
to take Notice of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Navel-String</em></span>;
<i>For</i> (says He) <i>if it be without folds or wrinkles, there is
but one</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span>; <i>if otherways, there’s a Child for every
Wrinkle</i>: But I think the expert <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Midwife</em></span> using
her <i>Hand</i>, as I have not unadvisedly inculcated<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c017'><sup>[199]</sup></a>,
will have but small Occasion for such <i>Observations</i>,
and far less <i>Need</i> to trust to them.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> when more than <i>one</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> is found, they
are distinguishable, (I mean <i>Superfætations</i>) from <i>These</i>
conceiv’d at one time; <i>those</i> having each a <i>peculiar</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Secundine</em></span>; <i>these</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>One</em></span> only in Commune: As
the <i>one</i> is also less vital and more imperfect, than the
<i>other</i>; according to the interval of Time betwixt their
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conceptions</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cure</i> or Prevention of this <i>Case</i> is much the
same with the following, <i>viz.</i></p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> III.</span><br /> <i>Of a Numerous</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>A <i>Numerous</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span> may happen either
with, or without <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Superfætation</em></span>:

<p class='c005'>I could also give many Instances of this sort of
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Births</em></span>, where 3, 4, 5, and more <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children</em></span>
have been <i>born at once</i>, but shall satisfy myself with <i>This</i>,
which I think is one of the most remarkable, <i>viz.</i>
<i>That</i> of the <i>Countess Margaret</i>,<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c017'><sup>[200]</sup></a> Daughter to <i>Florent</i>
IV. <i>Earl of Holland</i>, and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Spouse</em></span> to <i>Count Herman
of Heneberg</i>; who, on <i>Good-Friday</i>, in the Year of our
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lord</em></span> 1276, and of her <i>Age</i> 42, brought forth at
one <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span> 365 <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infants</em></span>; whereof 182, are said
to have been <i>Males</i>, as many <i>Females</i>, and the odd one
an <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hermaphrodite</em></span>: who were all <i>baptized</i>,
<i>those</i> by the Name of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>John</em></span>, <i>these</i> by that of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Elizabeth</em></span>,
in two <i>Brazen Dishes</i>, by <i>Don William,
Suffragan Bishop of Treves</i>. The <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Basons</em></span> are still
to be seen in the <i>Village Church</i> of <i>Losdun</i>, where all
<i>Strangers</i> go (on purpose) from the <i>Hague</i>, being
reckon’d among the great <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Curiosities</em></span> of <i>Holland</i>.
For farther and more instances of this Nature, I refer the
Curious to a large collected <i>History</i> of such, by the
<i>Author</i> mentioned in the <i>Margin</i><a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c017'><sup>[201]</sup></a>  From whence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>the Certainty of <i>Numerous</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conceptions</em></span> will
evidently appear.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AGAIN</em> the <i>Cause</i> of such <i>Numerous</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conceptions</em></span>
is (according to <i>Avicenna</i>’s just Opinion)
the <i>Division</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span> in numerous <i>Portions</i>, or
<i>Proportions</i>; which may happen, either because of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, or because of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Injector</em></span>: Because
of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, when its <i>Cavity</i> is larger than ordinary;
or when it too greedily <i>attracts</i> to all its Parts;
or when the divided <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span> adheres separately to the
singular <i>Uterine Veins</i>: Insomuch, that if what
has been recorded of the abovesaid <i>Countess</i> be
true, it is not improbable that, there may be a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>
for every <i>Orifice</i> of the <i>Uterine Veins</i>,
and that every <i>Vessel</i> may attract its own distinct <i>share</i>
of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seminal</em></span> <i>Matter</i>, and thereupon initiate a
respective <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>, tho’ it cannot possibly
bring it to <i>Perfection</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em> the same may also happen, because
of an irregular <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Injection</em></span>, namely, when
<i>that</i> is perform’d by <i>stops</i> and <i>intervals</i>; then the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> attracting accordingly, may occasion different
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conceptions</em></span>, according to the different <i>Immissions</i>
or <i>Divisions</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> these <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conceptions</em></span>, whether <i>two</i>,
<i>three</i>, or <i>more</i>, are always annexed to, and contained
in one common <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Secundine</em></span>. And tho’ the <i>Woman</i>,
by reason of her good Constitution of <i>Body</i> and
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, may do well in the time of <i>Gestation</i>, yet
her <i>Præternatural Condition</i> in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>, always
threatens <i>Danger</i>, as is already made out more manifestly<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c017'><sup>[202]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> as to the <i>Cure</i> or Prevention of both <i>this</i>
and the <i>preceding Case</i>, I know but one only grateful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Method of performing it; <i>viz.</i> by refrigerating and
reducing the too <i>calid</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> to a convenient <i>Temperature</i>,
and using a proper <i>Regimen</i> of <i>Health</i> and
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Diet</em></span>; and <i>that</i> both before and after <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>HAVING</em> already also particularly defin’d the
<i>real</i> or <i>true</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span> in <i>Sect.</i> III. Chap. I.
I come now in like manner to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Reverse</em></span> of that
<i>Case</i>, properly call’d a <i>false</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>. But
that I may, in this Point, be well understood,——</p>

<p class='c005'>A <i>False</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>, in my Opinion, is
nothing else, but a <i>Protuberancy</i> of the <i>Woman</i>’s
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Belly</em></span>, attended with some, if not with most, of
the <i>Symptoms</i> of the Months of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Gestation</em></span>:
which however, is no ways occasion’d by a humane
FOETUS, but (on the contrary) either by <i>Water</i>
and <i>Winds</i>, or <i>Wind</i> and <i>Water</i> vitiously mixed; which
is also pertinently call’d a <i>Dropsy</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>:
Or then, by a corrupted <i>Viscid</i>, or <i>pituitous Matter</i> collected
in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; and that either proceeding
from weak and vitious <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span>, or from some extraordinary
<i>Intemperature</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, which may hinder
the <i>Elaboration</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span>, and
consequently the <i>Accomplishment</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>:
Or the same may also finally proceed from the
<i>Impurity</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Menstrua</em></span>, which may corrupt
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span>, and convert it to <i>Aqueous</i>, <i>purulent</i>, or <i>other</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Humours</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>false</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span> is attended (besides
the common <i>Symptoms</i> of a <i>true</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>)
with inordinate <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fevers</em></span>, <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pains</em></span> of the <i>Head</i>,
<i>Neck</i>, <i>Loins</i>, <i>Groins</i>, <i>Back</i>, and <i>Belly</i>: Which <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Belly</em></span>
swells sooner than in the <i>Condition</i> of <i>real</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>;
and which, if struck with the <i>Hand</i>,
gives a <i>Sound</i> like a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Drum</em></span> whence ’tis also call’d a
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Tympany</em></span>: The whole <i>Body</i> is hence discoloured;
the <i>Feet</i>, and sometimes the <i>Face</i> swells; and only a
little (if any) <i>watery</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Milk</em></span> is found in the <i>Breasts</i>.
<em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Cure</i> of the <i>Case</i> depends entirely upon proper
<i>Evacuations</i>, peculiar to the <i>Quality</i> of what is to be
evacuated. Whence I come to treat of the <i>Conception</i>
of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moles</em></span>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>
<div  class='figcenter id003'>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> V.</span><br /> <i>Of</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moles</em></span>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>A <span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>MOLE</em></span> is properly nothing else, than a <i>fleshy
Mass</i> (instead of a <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em>) engender’d,
of an <i>imperfect</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>, in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>.
And is so call’d, because (<i>quasi Lapis Molaris</i>) like
a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mill-Stone</em></span>, its <i>weight</i> infests the <i>Woman</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THERE</em> are two immediate <i>Causes</i> of this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>
of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moles</em></span>, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Superfluity</i> of
Matter, and the <i>infirmity</i> of the <i>forming Faculty</i>.
Which, I think, is agreeable to <i>Hippocrates</i> his meaning,
saying, that <i>too much Menstruous Blood, or too
little, weak, or insufficient</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span>, <i>is the only Cause of a</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mole</em></span><a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c017'><sup>[203]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>I know, that besides these, there are many other
various <i>Causes</i> given by diverse <i>Authors</i>; yea I know that
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mole</em></span> it self is variously accepted among them:
But as I am not to insist upon the <i>quibbling</i> Notions of
other Men, so I shall only here observe,——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em>, that there is a vast Variety and Difference
in the <i>Substance</i>, as well as in the <i>Form</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moles</em></span>:
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Secondly</em></span>, That there is sometimes but <i>one</i>, <i>and</i>
sometimes <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, or <i>more</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moles</em></span>, contain’d in
<i>One</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; and <i>that</i>, sometimes with, and sometimes
without the <i>Natural</i> <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em> as also sometimes
separately, and sometimes adhering the <i>One</i> to
the <i>Other</i>: <em class='gesperrt'>THIRDLY</em>, That in this <i>Case</i>, if the
<em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em> be not directly kill’d by the <i>Compression</i> of
its tender Body, it is at least in <i>Danger</i> of being <i>misshaped</i>,
or perhaps <i>monstrously formed</i>, according to the
<i>Bulk</i>, <i>Weight</i>, and <i>Solidity</i> of what is contain’d with it
in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> in regard to the <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em>, when
we are certain of its <i>Existence</i>; tho’ in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>,
with <i>one</i> or <i>more</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moles</em></span>, it may perhaps be very
safe; Therefore I again observe, that, in this <i>Case</i>,
as long as the <i>Woman</i> is no ways endangered, the
<i>Exclusion</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Both</em></span> ought to be <i>Natural</i>, and accordingly
the <i>appointed Time</i> waited for: When according
to all <i>Authors</i>, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mole</em></span> comes sometimes
before, sometimes with, sometimes immediately after,
and sometimes a few Days, or perhaps Weeks, after
the <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em>. But such <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Midwives</em></span> as follow
my <i>Method</i>, already plainly laid down<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c017'><sup>[204]</sup></a>, will scarce
trust their <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span> with the Charge of a
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mole</em></span>, one moment after the <i>Birth</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span>
and <i>Secundine</i>: Because by such means, yea, even by a
small <i>Clod</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span>, which is a far less matter,
retain’d after the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>, <i>Millions</i> of Women have
lost their pretious <i>Lives</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the mean time, as <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moles</em></span> are most commonly
generated <i>alone</i>, without any <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em>; I
come now to indicate their peculiar <i>Diagnosticks</i>, which
the <i>Reader</i> may take as follows, <i>viz.</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span>, the
<i>Woman</i>’s <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Belly</em></span> swells equally in all its <i>Dimensions</i>;
whereas in <i>Case</i> of a <i>Natural</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>, it is
raised, and as it were acuminated or pointed towards
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Navel</em></span>, and a little compressed on <i>both sides</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, The <i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> never
shuts in <i>this</i>, as it does in the <i>Natural</i>, <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>:
And the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mole</em></span> may be distinctly felt by
the <i>Touch</i>, like a <i>Globular Mass</i>, in the <i>Region</i> of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Loins</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIRDLY</em>, Any <i>expert Woman</i> may also distinguish
this <i>Case</i>, by its <i>Motion</i>; which is very different
from that of a <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em>, as also from that
occasion’d by a <i>false</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span> as above described:
The <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em> having not only a <i>total</i>,
but also a <i>Partial Motion</i>; which always differs according
to the <i>Part</i> or <i>Member</i> moved; and is consequently
<i>first</i> perceived about the <i>fourth Month</i>:
Whereas the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mole</em></span> has no distinct <i>Motion</i>; only,
as the <i>Woman</i> turns to either <i>Side</i>, she may feel it
(like a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stone</em></span>) falling to the same <i>Side</i>; and in
her walking, she may easily perceive its <i>suppressing dead</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Weight</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOURTHLY</em>, Her <i>Breasts</i> swell, but give seldom
any manner of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Milk</em></span>, and about the 4th and 5th
<i>Months</i>, when she, who has a <i>Natural Conception</i>,
is commonly best in <i>Health</i>; then the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MOLE-BEARER</em></i>
falls worse; Her <i>Limbs</i> and <i>Legs</i> extenuate;
her <i>Face</i> and <i>Skin</i> are all over discoloured, as the whole
<i>Body</i> languishes; <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pains</em></span> of the <i>Back</i> and <i>Groins</i>
follow of Course, together with a Difficulty of <i>Respiration</i>;
as sometimes also, <i>Wind</i> and <i>Humours</i>
break out of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> the whole, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Prognostick</em></span>
of this <i>Case</i> is, that as the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MOLE-BEARING</em>
Woman</i> must in all respects, be very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>much discommoded, and afflicted with heavy
threatning <i>Symptoms</i>, so she lives continually in Danger
of her Life: And the longer she entertains this unwieldy
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Guest</em></span>, the more rigid it grows, and the
closer it sticks to her; so that consequently, the more difficult
it is to dislodge or extract this <i>præternatural Body</i>:
For as the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mole</em></span> has no <i>Secundine</i>, nor <i>Umbilical
Vessels</i>, but adhering by its own gross <i>Substance</i> to
the oppress’d <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, attracting its <i>Nourishment</i> directly
from the <i>Uterine Vessels</i>; So it also fixes it self more
and more strongly, and the longer the more firmly
among them, to the great Prejudice and Damage of
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nature</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em>, as to the <i>Cure</i>, or the <i>Delivery</i> of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mole</em></span>, as has been said, the <i>sooner</i> it is undertaken,
the easier it is performed: And in this <i>Case</i>, I know
all <i>Authors</i> advise only, to endeavour its <i>Expulsion</i> by
<i>Bleeding in the Feet</i>, <i>by proper Baths</i>, <i>by strong and Acrid
Clysters</i>, &amp;c. in order by such like <i>means</i>, to excite or
stir up <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Throws</em></span> to open the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> and irritate
the <i>expulsive Faculty</i>. But for my part, I would not
too much afflict the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span> with these uncertain
<i>means</i>, especially if the <i>Præternatural Body</i> be of any long
standing; but rather at once betake my self, to that
which cannot fail me, <i>that</i> is the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hand-Cure</em></span>;
after Bathing, relaxing and moistening the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Passages</em></span>
with <i>Oils</i> or <i>emollient Ointments</i>: And <i>This</i>
I would undertake, and perform after the same manner,
as in the <i>Condition</i> of a <i>Dead Child</i>, when the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Pains</span></em>
are altogether <i>Deficient</i>. Again farther——</p>

<p class='c005'>I observe that, of all the <i>Countries</i> I know,
there is none, whose <i>Women</i> are so subject to <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Molar
Conceptions</em></span>, as the <i>Provinces of Holland</i>:
And moreover, by what I have diligently observ’d my self
in those <i>Parts</i>, as well as by what I have comprehended
from their most <i>Learned Men</i>, the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MOLES</em></i> generally
conceived there, are very different from <i>Others</i> commonly
conceived in <i>other Parts</i>; Insomuch that
<i>Those</i> are of a strange, astonishing, deformed <i>shape</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>having (as it were) something in them like the <i>Rudiments</i>
of a <i>Work imperfectly begun</i>; such a <i>Piece</i>,
as, for Example, a <i>Limner</i> may draw at the
first <i>Draught</i>, with a rude <i>Pensil</i>; together with something
of both <i>Life</i> and <i>Motion</i>: <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Living</em></span> however
only (as it were) <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vitâ Plantæ</span></i>, and moving but by
<i>Palpitation</i>; as I have also seen and observ’d this
<i>Body</i> to contract it self sensibly at the <i>Touch</i>, and immediately
again dilate it self perceptibly. In the <i>interim</i>
I must farther observe in this Place, that most
commonly <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nature</em></span> ejects these <i>Bodies</i> happily
about the <i>fourth Month</i>; however yet, not always <i>all</i> at
once, but most frequently by <i>Piece-Meal</i> and in <i>Heaps</i>,
not unlike as the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pump</em></span> does the <i>Bilge-Water</i> out of
the <i>Ship</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> here it may be <i>ask’d</i>, why the <i>Dutch good
Women</i>, should be more subject to these <i>Præternatural
Conceptions</i> than any <i>others</i>? To which I <i>answer</i>,
according to the Sense and Sentiments of most of
<i>their own greatest Men</i>; <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span>, that all over these
<i>Provinces</i>, the very <i>Borders</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sea</em></span> are inhabited,
and a World of People live (as it were) in the very
<i>Jaws</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Ocean</em></span>; whose bellowing <i>Waves</i> and
tumultuous <i>Surges</i>, are not only obvious to their <i>Eyes</i>
all Day, but obnoxious also to their <i>Ears</i> all Night
long; as they continually beat upon their <i>Coasts</i>, and
sometimes too near their very <i>Doors</i>: From whence
these <i>Women</i> cannot but be much affected and disturbed,
if not also frighted in their very <i>Embraces</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> yet, I do not conceive <i>This</i> to be
always the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Cause</em></span>, since <i>MOLAR CONCEPTIONS</i>
are also very common in their greatest <i>Cities</i>; But as
<i>those</i> happen there most frequently among the <i>Sea-faring
Men’s Wives</i>; so, I think, we may rationally
account for them after this ensuing manner, <i>viz.</i> The
<i>Sailers</i> arriving from their <i>Voyages</i>, and coming Home
merrily with full Sail up to their very Doors, incontinently
embrace their <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Wives</em></span>, without having any
regard to their <i>Natural Course</i>, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Silent Moon</em></span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>or any other <i>Circumstance</i>; And the honest <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Wives</em></span>,
having perhaps long wanted their <i>Husbands</i>, make no
<i>Procrastination</i>, but eagerly fall to enjoying <i>One Another</i>;
the good <i>Women</i> attracting as greedily the
virile Benevolence, as <i>Nature</i> can prompt, or as <i>Cerberus</i>
could snap at a <i>Piece</i>, or the <i>Hunger-starved</i> a <i>Bit</i>
of <i>Bread</i>. Upon which, if no <i>Efluxion</i> happens in
the Beginning, <i><em class='gesperrt'>NATURE</em></i> being incapable of <i>elaborating</i>
such an <i>unapt confused Matter</i>, it is converted to
a <i><em class='gesperrt'>MOLE</em></i>; which (as aforesaid) is frequently cast
forth about the <i>fourth Month</i>, and call’d by them <i>een
Manekindt</i>, as we for the same reason call it a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon-Calf</em></span>.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEN</em> the <i>Parts</i> destinated to the <i>Generation of
Man</i>, are in all respects well constituted, <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nature</em></span>
in the Beginning fabricates a fair and comely

own kind, absolutely perfected, and compleatly furnished
with all its own graceful <i>Ornaments</i>: Whereas
if any <i>Deficiency</i>, <i>Enormity</i>, <i>Fault</i> or <i>Blemish</i> be actually
in <i>Those Parts</i>, then the <i>conglomerated Principles</i> of
<i><em class='gesperrt'>GENERATION</em></i> are variously form’d into different
Sorts of <i>prodigious <em class='gesperrt'>CONCEPTIONS</em></i> and <i>Monstrous
<em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em></i>. However——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WITH</em> respect to the <i>Variety</i>, as well as the
<i>Veracity</i> of this <i><em class='gesperrt'>SUBJECT</em></i>, that I may make short

<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>have been Born, but also particularly noted the <i>Times</i>
and <i>Places</i> of their <i><em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em></i>; which they have authentically
collected from many creditable <i>Authors</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the small Conversation, by the <i>By</i>, which I
have had either at Home or Abroad with the <i>Learned</i>,
I have met with none who have deny’d the <i>Truth</i> of
this <i><em class='gesperrt'>POSITION</em></i> in <i>general</i>; tho’ some of my <i>Superiors</i>
in this Place, have been pleas’d to contradict in
<i>particular</i>, what I am just now going (and chiefly for
that very reason) about to publish to the World, in
the next following <i>Chapter</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> notwithstanding that we all agree as to the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>FACT</em></i>, yet I have found but few ready to discuss the
proper <i>Causes</i> of <i>Monstrous <em class='gesperrt'>BIRTHS</em></i>: Only so far,
that <i>some</i> would have them to proceed immediately
from the Commixture of <i>Humane</i> with <i>Brutal <em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i>;
<i>others</i>, directly from the <i><em class='gesperrt'>INFLUX</em></i> of the <i>Stars</i>;
<i>Some</i> again, from a vitious <i>Constitution</i>, or oblique
<i>Situation</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>; others also, from a <i>Lascivious</i>
and enormous <i>Act</i> of <i>Copulation</i>; and <i>some</i> at
last, from the sordid and corrupted <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEMINAL</em> Matter</i>
of the <i>Persons Copulating</i>. Which may be all indeed,
in some respect, consentaneous to <i>Reason</i>; but notwithstanding,
in speaking to such <i>Causes</i>, I think, we
ought previously to consider the <i>Requisites</i> concurring
to the <i>Production</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em>; what they naturally
are, and how they ought to be <i>qualify’d</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span> and chief of which is the <i>Forming
Faculty</i>; 2ly. The <i>two Instruments</i>, by which this
<i>Faculty</i> operates, <i>viz.</i> the <i><em class='gesperrt'>SPIRIT</em></i> or innate <i>Seminal
Heat</i>, and the <i>Imagination</i>, 3ly. <i>The <em class='gesperrt'>MATTER</em></i>,
viz. both the <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEEDS</em></i>, and the <i>Menstruous Blood</i>;
4ly. And lastly, the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PLACE</em></i>, namely the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>:
Whence I conclude that any <i>one</i>, or <i>more</i>, or (perhaps)
all of <i><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em></i>, degenerating from their <i>due state</i> or
<i>natural Qualities</i>, may prove the <i>Cause</i> or <i>Causes</i> of a
<i><em class='gesperrt'>MONSTROUS CONCEPTION</em></i>, or <i>Æquivocal
<em class='gesperrt'>GENERATION</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the <i>Forming Faculty</i>, it never errs or fails,
but always performs its <i>Duty</i>, as far as depends upon
it self, or its own <i>Intention</i>; tho’ indeed it often happens
to be frustrated by the <i>Instrumentary Causes</i>:
As the most ingenious <i>Artificer</i> cannot finish his <i>Work</i>,
however successfully begun, without a proportionable
<i>Metal</i> to work upon, and corresponding <i>Instruments</i> to
work by; So it is, in this <i>Case</i>, with the <i>Forming Faculty</i>:
Hence it is that <i><em class='gesperrt'>MONSTERS</em></i> are also pertinently
call’d, as they undeniably are, the <i>Works</i> of
<i><em class='gesperrt'>NATURE</em></i>; however degenerating from its proper
<i><em class='gesperrt'>END</em></i>, that it may effect something, even such a
<i><em class='gesperrt'>MONSTER</em></i>, rather than that the indigested and unalterated
<i>Matter</i> should remain in the <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>, and
turn either to a <i><em class='gesperrt'>MOLE</em></i> or a <i><em class='gesperrt'>STONE</em></i>, as has often
happened<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c017'><sup>[205]</sup></a>. Which being thus consider’d, we shall
find the <i>Error</i> or <i>Fault</i> to ly either in the <i>Instruments</i>,
in the <i>Matter</i>, or in the <i>Place</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FIRST</em> then, as to the <i>Instruments</i>, of the <i>two</i>
above-mentioned, I take the <i>Imagination</i> to have the
most prevalent <i>Power</i> in <i><em class='gesperrt'>CONCEPTION</em></i>; which I
hope may be readily granted, considering how common
a Thing it is, for the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MOTHER</em></i> to mark her
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> with <i>Pears</i>, <i>Plums</i>, <i>Milk</i>, <i>Wine</i>, or any <i>thing
else</i>, upon the least trifling <i>Accident</i> happening to her
from thence; and <i>that</i> even in the latter ripening
<i>Months</i>, after the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant</em></span> is entirely formed, by
the <i>Strength of her Imagination</i> only, as has been already
manifestly set forth at large<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c017'><sup>[206]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHICH</em> if so, Pray, what wonder is it, if the
<i>Woman</i> in time of <i><em class='gesperrt'>CONCEPTION</em></i> (which is by far
the more <i>critical Juncture</i>) should by the same reason
<i>conceive</i>, and at last bring forth her <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em>
with a <i>Calf</i>’s, <i>Lamb</i>’s, <i>Dog</i>’s, <i>Cat</i>’s-<i><em class='gesperrt'>HEAD</em></i>, or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span><i>Effigy</i> of any other thing whatsoever? And <i>this</i> the
more especially, considering, that not only the <i>conceiving
Woman</i>, but also the <i>copulating Man</i>, may effect
the same thing; if he should imprudently set his
Mind on such Objects, or employ his perverted <i>Imagination</i>
that way. Now this absurd <i>Imagination</i>
takes even place also among the very <em class='gesperrt'><i>BRUTES</i></em>, as
<i>Lemnius</i> relates<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c017'><sup>[207]</sup></a> of a <i>Sheep</i> with a <i>Seal’s</i>, or <i>Sea-<em class='gesperrt'>CALF’S HEAD</em></i>,
having no doubt seen that Animal
in the critical Time of <i>Conjunction</i> or <i>Conception</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> like manner, supposing such <i>Women</i> to conceive
in their Minds, some deformed <em class='gesperrt'><i>SPIRIT</i></em> or <em class='gesperrt'><i>ANIMAL</i></em>,
with <i>Horns</i>, <i>Snout</i>, <i>Wings</i>, <i>Cloven-Feet</i>, &amp;c.
(as has sometimes happen’d) What should hinder this
<i>Woman</i> to produce a <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Birth</span></em> with these <i>Monstrous
Marks</i>? <em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> is also therefore very possible, but
more especially, when the <i>Disposition</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Matter</span></em>
acquiesces, which it certainly does when the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Seed</span></em> and <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Blood</span></em> are impure: For, Is it not manifest
to our <i>Eyes</i>, that some <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Children</span></em> bring with
them long <i>Hair</i> and <i>Nails</i> into the World, merely
from the <i>Impurity</i> of these <i>material Substances</i>? Then
supposing the <i>Force</i> of an absurd <i>Imagination</i> to have
seconded the <i>Efficacy</i> of such <i>Sordid Stuff</i>, what a
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Monster</span></em> might not <i>these</i> Jointly have produced?
Wherefore I shall only add upon the whole of <i>This</i>,
that as such impious and foolish <i>Imaginations</i> ought to
be suppressed, so both the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Seed</span></em> and the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Blood</span></em>
ought to be pure and temperate, to prevent such <i>præternatural
Productions</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em>, as to the <i>Heat</i> and <i>Spirit</i> contain’d in the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Seed</span></em>, we may easily conceive its <i>Effects</i>, and such as
have been in <i>Glass-Works</i>, and have seen <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Glasses</span></em>,
made, may readily comprehend how <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Monsters</span></em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>are formed in the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>: For in modeling the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Glass</span></em>, if the <i>Work-Man</i> blow the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Pipe</span></em> too much
or too strongly, the <i>Stuff</i> is so extended, that the
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Glass</span></em> becomes both <i>longer</i> and <i>wider</i> than its due
proportionable <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Form</span></em>; and so it may also happen in
the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Womb</span></em>, by an <i>immoderate Action</i>, or too great
an <i>Extension</i> or <i>Diffusion</i> of the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Seminal Spirit</span></em>,
which sometimes may only affect some <i>particular
Part</i>, such as the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Head</span></em>, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Nose</span></em>, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Mouth</span></em>,
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Ears</span></em>, <i>&amp;c.</i> and sometimes the <i>whole</i> <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em>
disproportionably.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, Hence we may rationally conclude,
that a <i>superfluity</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Seed</span></em>, and <i>super-abundancy</i>
of material <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Humours</span></em> may, in like manner, produce
<i>duplicated Members</i>, such as <i>Two</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Heads</span></em>, <i>Four</i>
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Hands</span></em>, <i>Four</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Feet</span></em>, <i>Six</i> or <i>more</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Toes</span></em> or <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Fingers</span></em>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> and <i>this</i> especially, in case of the <i>Woman’s</i>
strange <i>Imagination</i> concurring; which may
easily happen, by fancying herself sometimes to <i>see
double</i> with her <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Eyes</span></em>, which <i>Deception</i> may probably
proceed from the <i>Concourse</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Humours</span></em>, gross
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Vapours</span></em>, and confused or distracted <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Spirits</span></em>.
And <i>This</i> in short, it is evident, holds also good among
the <i>other Creatures</i> (<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Irrationals</span></em>) as
<i>Lemnius</i> writes<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c017'><sup>[208]</sup></a> of himself, that He saw a <i>Sheep</i> and
a <i>Calfe</i>, each with <i>two</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Heads</span></em>, and a <i>Hen</i> with
<i>four</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Feet</span></em> and as many <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Wings</span></em>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AGAIN</em>, as from the <i>Superabundance</i> of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Matter</span></em>,
<i>Geminated Members</i>, or Superfluous Particles may proceed;
so from the <i>Scarcity</i> of these <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>Matters</span></em>,
<i>Want</i> of requisite <i>Aliment</i>, or from any partial <i>Invalidity</i>
of the <i>Natural Faculties</i>, some <i>Members</i> or
certain <i>Particles</i> may be either maim’d and destitute
of their <i>Natural Use</i>, or then (which is worse) be
altogether <i>irregular</i>, <i>defective</i>, or <i>Unnatural</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span><em class='gesperrt'>LASTLY</em> as to the <i>Place</i>, I mean the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>,
in which the <i>Conception</i> is made; It ought not only
to be <i>perpendicularly seated</i> in the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PELVIS</em></i>, or in a
<i>direct line</i> from the <i><em class='gesperrt'>VAGINA</em></i> upwards, but also to be
well conform’d and proportion’d: Otherways, as an
ugly or unshapely exteriour <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Form</em></span> or <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mould</em></span> of
<i>Wax</i> or <i>Clay</i>, produces a corresponding deformed
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Image</em></span> cast therein; so the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> may as effectually
be the <i>Cause</i> of a <i>Deform’d</i> or <i>Monstrous</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>.
And moreover not only so, but the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> ought
also to be in its due <i>Temperament</i> and <i>Natural State</i>,
free of all <i>Distempers</i> and Inconveniencies, such as obdurated
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Glands</em></span>, <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Ulcers</em></span>, <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Cicatrices</em></span>, <i>&amp;c.</i>
Otherways, as a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Tree</em></span> planted in <i>Stony Ground</i>, its
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Root</em></span> cannot diffuse or spread it self round every
way, but being cramp’d and oppress’d, it <i>crooks</i> and
<i>bends back</i>; So it is with the <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em> in the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, if oppos’d and resisted by the <i>Constriction</i>
or <i>Coarctation of the Place</i>, or by any inherent <i>Præternatural
Substance</i>, its <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Members</em></span> cannot possibly be
<i>articulately</i> and <i>distinctly form’d</i>, much less can they attain
their <i>Natural</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Growth</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Figure</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> short from what is here said, I think, the <i>Notions</i>
of such Men, as will have <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Monsters</em></span>, only
and immediately to proceed from a <i>Coition</i> with
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Brutes</em></span>, may evidently appear as <i>absurd</i> as <i>they</i>
are verily <i>groundless</i><a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c017'><sup>[209]</sup></a>: And for strengthening or
backing of my <i>Authority</i>, I may add <i>Galen</i>’s own
Words<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c017'><sup>[210]</sup></a>, saying, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vel semen Humanum in Utero Equæ,
vel Equinum in utero Muliebri, aut non admitti, aut
admissum corrumpi</span></i>. Which is also farther confirm’d
by Holy St. <i>Jerom</i>, saying,<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c017'><sup>[211]</sup></a> <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non minùs absurdum est,
Animal construi ex Equo &amp; Homine, quàm Vitem Olivæ
insertam, simul vinum &amp; oleum proserre</span></i>. Which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span><i>Doctrine</i> seems also most agreeable to <i>Truth</i>, in <i>that</i>
there can be no <i>Affinity</i> or <i>Concord</i> betwixt <i>these</i> Specifically
different <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEEDS</em></i>, neither in their <i>Natural
Actions</i>, <i>Aliment</i>, <i>Maturation</i>, <i>Time</i>, or <i>Manner</i> of <i>Birth</i>,
&amp;c. to pass by all other <i>disconsonant</i> or <i>incongruous
Circumstances</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fine</em></span> therefore, for these <i>Reasons</i>, I believe
Nothing of the many <i>fabulous Relations</i> extant, of
the <i>Hippocentauri</i>, <i>Onocentauri</i>, <i>Minotauri</i>, &amp;c. inhabiting
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Land</em></span>, nor of the <i>Tritons</i>, <i>Nereids</i>,
<i>Syrens</i>, &amp;c. which are said to possess the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sea</em></span>; tho’
indeed both St. <i>Antony</i><a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c017'><sup>[212]</sup></a>, and St. <i>Jerom</i><a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c017'><sup>[213]</sup></a>, maintain
the Existence of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Satyri</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sylvani</em></span>:
But be these Things as they will, I believe, that the
<i>Production</i> of every <i><em class='gesperrt'>MONSTER</em></i>, concurs to the <i>Perfection</i>
of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>UNIVERSE</em></i>, and that sometimes
such <i>Prodigies</i>, or rather <i>Dæmonical Illusions</i>, may appear,
as well as <i>Monstrous</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Births</em></span> happen, by the
Will and Pleasure of the great <i><em class='gesperrt'>CREATOR</em></i>, who would
thereby signify and portend something <i>extraordinary</i>,
or more than <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Natural</em></span> to us <i>Mortals</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VII.</span><br /> <i>Of various deformed</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conceptions</em></span>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> particular <i>Description</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>MONSTROUS
CONCEPTIONS</em></i> in the preceding <i>Chapter</i>,
leads me, of Course, to treat of <i>another Sort</i>; which
I shall comprehend under the <i>Title</i> of <i>Deformed <em class='gesperrt'>CONCEPTIONS</em></i>.
<i>This Sort</i> happening almost in <i>all
Countries</i> promiscuously, tho’ in <i>some</i> more frequently
than in <i>others</i>, becomes almost in <i>all Parts</i> Daily obvious
to our <i>Eyes</i>, so that we need be at no great
Pains to prove the <i>Reality</i> of <i>deformed</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Births</em></span>, but
rather inquire into the <i>Causes</i> of such uncouth <i><em class='gesperrt'>CONCEPTIONS</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> short therefore as to <i>these</i>, if we only look
back and reflect on the three preceding <i>Chapters</i>, we
will find the <i>Causes</i> of the <i>present Case</i> very evident
and sufficiently manifest, if not particularly included
in the <i>Latter</i>: Wherefore I have only farther here
to observe, that all such <i>Præternatural <em class='gesperrt'>CONCEPTIONS</em></i>,
degenerate from the <i>Natural</i>, in proportion
to the <i>Prevalency</i> of their <i>Cause</i> or <i>Causes</i>; So that
the <i>Cause</i> being less considerable in <i>this</i>, than in the
<i>foregoing Case</i>, instead of a <i><em class='gesperrt'>MONSTROUS</em></i>, we have
only a <i>deformed</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>: Such as a <i>Scurf-Head</i>, a
<i>discolour’d Skin</i>, an <i>ugly Visage</i>, <i>disagreeable Features</i>,
<i>distorted Mouth</i>, <i>crooked Nose</i>, <i>Legs</i>, or <i>Arms</i>, maim’d
in <i>whole</i> or in <i>Part</i>, <i>Tumours</i>, <i>Pustules</i>, or <i>Bubos</i> about
the <i>Groins</i>, &amp;c. Which, tho’ <i>these</i> and such like <i>Accidents</i>
may verily proceed from either of the forementioned
<i>Causes</i>; Yet I think, the most common and
ordinary <i>One</i>, in all Countries, is an impure and unseasonable
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Copulation</em></span>: Such as is not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>precisely forbid by the <i>Express Word</i> of <i>God</i><a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c017'><sup>[214]</sup></a>, but
also repugnant to right <i>Reason</i>, and even to common
<i>Sense</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOR</em> who can be so stupid as not to conceive,
that this <i>Menstruous Contagion</i>, will naturally (tho’
insensibly) creep into the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span>, invade the whole
<i>Habit of the Body</i>, and tacitely infect the very <i>soundest
Constitution</i>, even sometimes with the <i>Venereal</i> <em class='gesperrt'>Pox</em>,
or perhaps with an <i>Elephantiasis</i>, or the <i>Leprosy</i> it self?
Nor does this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Evil</em></span> end always here, but such
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Births</em></span> are also generally as perverse in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mind</em></span>,
as they are <i>Heterogeneous</i> in the <i>Person</i>; for like <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Bastards</em></span>
of <i>Nature</i>, they are commonly denudated,
or destitute of all her laudable <i>Gifts</i> and <i>Graces</i>,
which others, her <i>Legitimate</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sons</em></span>, are happily
born with and enjoy in Abundance.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> it is, that, if they become not altogether
<i>Jolt-Heads</i>, <i>Foolish</i>, or <i>Delirious</i>, they are most ordinarily
otherways <i>Lewd</i>, <i>Vitious</i>, and <i>Licentious Persons</i>,
if not also <i>envious Traducers</i>, and <i>crafty Cozeners</i> of
Mankind: From hence likewise the <i>Italians</i> and
<i>Germans</i> derive a memorable <i><em class='gesperrt'>PROVERB</em></i>, which they
never forget upon dealing with such <i>Persons</i>, viz. to
this purpose; <i>Take Care of Him whom</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>God</em></span> <i>has marked</i>.
For tho’ <i>some of Them</i>, are capable of undertaking
<i>Nothing</i> of any Moment, much less of accomplishing
any laudable <i>Work</i>, <i><em class='gesperrt'>NATURE</em></i> it self thwarting
their <i>Career</i> in every <i>Enterprize</i>, and the very <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stars</em></span>
(as it were) concurring to their <i>Frustrations</i>: Yet
<i>others</i> have subtile <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Witt</em></span> enough to scrape together
(<i>per Fas aut Nefas</i>) Heaps of contemptible <i>Dross</i>,
much of affinity with their own vile <i>Substance</i>; which
however, seldom prevents a base or ignominious <i><em class='gesperrt'>CATASTROPHE</em></i>
to <i>themselves</i>, who are thus found
established upon such a <i>præternatural</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Basis</em></span> of <i>Pollution</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> then <i>these</i> be the direful <i>Consequences</i>, how unreasonably
cruel are such <i>Parents</i>, who thus by Enterprising
the Work of <i><em class='gesperrt'>PROCREATION</em></i> without
<i>humane Decency</i>, and contrary to the very <i>Institution</i>
of <i><em class='gesperrt'>NATURE</em></i>, involve their <i>Posterity</i>, in such miserable
<i>Calamities</i>? But this sort of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Births</em></span>, I have also
diligently observ’d, happens most frequently in <i>Holland</i>,
and <i>that</i> chiefly for the <i>Reasons</i> and <i>Causes</i> mentioned
in the foregoing <i>Chapter</i>. Which <i>Observation</i> leads me
to the following <i>Matter of</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fact</em></span>, which (without
any intended <i>Reflection</i>, or <i>Reproach</i> upon any particular
<i>Country</i>, or rather, as <i>this</i> would be, upon <i>Human
Nature</i> it self) I shall ingenuously relate, not only to
clear up the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MYSTERY</em></i> of a certain <i>Truth</i>, which I
have found, to be <i>controverted</i> in this Place, and <i>that</i>
even among some of the more <i>Learned</i> themselves;
but also for <i>Morality</i> and <i>Instruction</i> sake to the <i>Reader</i>
in particular, and for the <i>common Good</i> of <i>Mankind</i>
in general, <i>viz.</i>——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THAT</em> these <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Births</em></span> in those <i>Parts</i>, are often
attended and accompany’d with a <i>Monstrous little Animal</i>,
the likest of any thing in Shape and Size to a
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moodiwarp</em></span>; having a <i>hooked Snout</i>, <i>fiery sparkling
Eyes</i>, a long <i>round Neck</i>, and an acuminated
<i>short Tail</i>, of an extraordinary <i>Agility</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>FEET</em></i>.
At first <i>sight</i> of the World’s Light, it commonly <i>Yells</i> and
<i>Shrieks</i> fearfully; and seeking for a <i>lurking Hole</i>, runs up
and down like a <i>little Dæmon</i>, which indeed I took it
for, the first time I saw it, and <i>that</i> for none of the
<i>better Sort</i>. Moreover——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> following <i>accidental Passage</i> is so remarkable,
that I cannot pass it by, in order to satisfy and convince
<i>others</i> of this admirable <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Truth</em></span>; Namely,
that, not many Years ago, in coming from <i>Germany</i>
over East and West <i>Friesland</i>, to <i>Holland</i>, I took Passage
in the ordinary <i>Fare-Vessel</i>, from the City of <i>Harlingen</i>
for <i>Amsterdam</i>, over what they call the <i>Zuyder-Zee</i>;
Which is commonly reckon’d a <i>Voyage</i> of 10 or 12,
Hours, tho’ at this Time we happen’d to be near 36
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>Hours on our <i>Passage</i>. Amongst the better Sort of the
<i>Passengers</i>, who possess’d the <i>Cabine</i>, there happen’d
to be a <i>Woman big with Child</i>, of a very creditable
<i>Aspect</i>, who afterwards told me, that She was bound
for <i>Amsterdam</i>, on purpose to buy some Necessaries
for her <i>lying-in</i> at the easiest rate; when in the <i>interim</i>,
the good Provident <i>Woman</i>, was taken all at once,
aboard the <i>Ship</i>, with a sudden and surprizing <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Labour</em></span>:
Upon which occasion, in short I immediately
lent her a <i>helping Hand</i>, and upon the <i>Membrane</i>’s
giving way, this forementioned <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Animal</em></span> made
its wonderful <i>Egress</i>; filling my <i>Ears</i> with dismal
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Shrieks</em></span>, and my <i>Mind</i> with greater <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Consternation</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEN</em> not immediately recollecting what I
had either heard or read of this <i><em class='gesperrt'>MONSTER</em></i>, I
could not help continuing in my Surprize, until I
heard some of our <i>Accidental Company</i> call it <i>de Suyger</i>,
as they went about to kill it: Upon which I immediately
laid the <i>Woman</i> of a pretty <i>plump</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Girl</em></span>;
who, notwithstanding all this, had no <i>Deformity</i> upon
it, save only many <i>dark</i>, <i>livid</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Spots</em></span> all over its
Body; which I prognosticated might turn to a <i>Universal</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Scurf</em></span>. In the mean time I order’d the
<i>Express’d Oil</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Almonds</em></span> to be diligently us’d,
as soon as we landed.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AFTERWARDS</em> I had occasion to talk with
some of the most <i>learned Men</i>, of the several famous
Universities in these <i>Provinces</i> upon this Head; who
ingenuously told me, that it was so common a Thing,
among the <i>Sea-faring</i>, and <i>meaner sort of People</i>, that
scarce <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>One</em></span> of these <i>Women</i> in <i>Three</i> escaped this
kind of strange <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>; which my own small <i>Practice</i>
among them afterwards also confirmed: Insomuch,
that I always as much expected the Thing <i>de Suyger</i>,
as the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Child</em></span> it self: And besides the <i>Women</i> in
like manner, make a respective suitable <i>Preparation</i>,
to receive it warmly, and throw it into the <i>Fire</i>;
holding <i>Sheets</i> before the <i>Chimney</i>, that it may not get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>off; as it always endeavours to save it self, by getting
into some <i>dark Hole</i> or <i>Corner</i>. They properly call it
<i>de Suyger</i>, which is (in our Language) the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sucker</em></span>,
because, like a <i>Leech</i>, it sucks up the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Infant’s</em></span>
<i>Blood</i> and <i>Aliment</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> this <i>Head</i>, and to this <i>Purpose</i>, I might
produce the <i>Authorities</i> of sundry good <i>Writers</i>, but
shall content my self here at present with <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>One</em></span> of
the same <i>Nation</i>, viz.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c017'><sup>[215]</sup></a> The most Learned and
Eminent <i>Levinus Lemnius</i>, who gives us a very remarkable
and particular Account at large, of a certain
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>, which began with a <i><em class='gesperrt'>MONSTROUS
MOLE</em></i>, succeeded by the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sucker</em></span>, and ended with
the <i>Production</i> of an excarnificated <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Male-Child</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> things then being so, and proceeding merely
from the immediate <i>Reasons</i> above-mentioned, ought
to serve for a memorable <i>Caution</i> to all <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Parents</em></span>,
that, in their conjugal <i>Duties</i>, they behave themselves
orderly and decently, not like insatiable <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Brutes</em></span>;
but, like rational <i>Men</i>, to the end that their <i>Families</i>
may be preserved, and their <i>Persons</i> succeeded, not
by an opprobrious <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Race</em></span>, but, by a <i>univocal Generation</i>
of hopeful <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Children</em></span>, Men of <i>Probity</i>
and <i>Integrity</i> both in <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Body</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mind</em></span>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> VIII.</span><br /> <i>Of Imaginary</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conceptions</em></span>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THERE</em> remains yet one Sort of <i>spurious</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>,
which happens without any
<i>virile Help</i> or <i>Assistance</i>, merely by the Force of
<i>Imaginary VENERY</i>: Especially among <i>Salacious
Women</i>, a <i>Seminal Fluxion</i> may happen upon many
coherent occasions; which joining and incorporating
with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Menstruous Blood</em></span>, may be so
much fomented by the <i>Uterine Calidity</i>, and the other
<i>Faculties</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, that the <i>Rudiments</i> of
an imperfect <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Animal</em></span> may be amassed and conceived.
But——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> the <i>Masculine <em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i> (the <i>efficient Cause</i>)
which ministers both <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Form</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Life</em></span>, is wanting,
it can assume neither of these Perfections: The
<i>Maternal Matter</i> serving only to bring it to a rude
indigested <i>Consistency</i>, or a confused fleshy <i>Substance</i> of
a strange and uncommon <i>FIGURE</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> in short, is no ways improbable, if we
consider that <i><em class='gesperrt'>HENS</em></i>, without the <i><em class='gesperrt'>COCK</em></i>’s assistance,
lay <i>Eggs</i>; however, of such a <i>Nature</i>, that
whatever Pains the <i><em class='gesperrt'>HEN</em></i> is afterwards at to <i>sit</i> and
<i>brood</i> upon them, the <i>Eggs</i> can never be animated so
as to produce <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHICKENS</em></i>. Or, if we consider,
that tho’ <i>feminine Trees</i> or <i>Roots</i>, having of themselves
less <i>Power</i> and <i>Strength</i>, as they are only imbued with
a <i>frigid</i> and <i>infœcund Humidity</i>, may smile a little in
their <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEASON</em></i>; yet, because of the natural <i>Deficiency</i>
of <i><em class='gesperrt'>HEAT</em></i>, and their innate <i>Debility</i> or <i>Impotency</i>,
they only yield an empty or imperfect <i>Rudiment</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>of either <i><em class='gesperrt'>FRUIT</em></i> or <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i>, unless, by the <i>Vicinity</i>
and delectable <i>Conjunction</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MALE</em></i>, they participate
of its <i>Fœcundity</i>, as <i>Pliny</i> testifies<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c017'><sup>[216]</sup></a> of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Palm</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AGREEABLE</em> to <i>this Position</i>, the Practical Observations
of many eminent <i>Physicians</i>, teach us, that
<i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMEN</em></i> have and may conceive at this rate, without
any <i>virile Energy</i> or <i>Concurrence</i>; of which
Dr. <i>Burnet</i><a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c017'><sup>[217]</sup></a> gives us a notable Instance, concerning
a certain <i>Noble-Woman</i>, a <i>Matron</i> of undoubted
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Virtue</em></span>, who some Years after her <i>Course of
Nature</i> had alter’d, in the 56th of her Age, brought
forth several fleshy <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moles</em></span>, as he calls them, and
<i>that</i> attended with a great <i>Flooding</i>, and the most
severe <i>Pains</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Labour</em></span>, as if in the <i>Case</i> of a
<i>Natural</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>. Again moreover——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>DO</em> we not know, in fine, that the <i>necessitous</i>, and
such as suffer <i>Want</i>, may be refreshed purely by the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Savour</em></span> of our <i>Dishes</i>? And that the <i>Hunger-starved</i>
may be satiated merely by the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Odours</em></span> of
our <i>Kitchins</i>? As possibly thus may the <i>marriageable</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Girl</em></span>, but more readily however the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Widow</em></span>, fill
her self with her own odd <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Imagination</em></span>; and
being debarr’d the <i>Enjoyment</i> of her <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Paramour</em></span>,
hug him tacitely in her <i>Bosom</i>, and embrace him
heartily, however <i>absent</i>, in her <i>Mind</i>. Which, if
frequently done, may occasion a <i>Collection</i> and <i>Commixture</i>
of gross <i>Humours</i> in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; whence
a <i>deformed Concretion</i>, or <i>shapeless</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mass</em></span>, may be
engendred, and <i>that</i> only by <i>Imaginary <em class='gesperrt'>VENERY</em></i>.
To which <i>Case</i> and <i>Purpose</i>, I think, <i>Virgil</i>, very pertinently
alludes,<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c017'><sup>[218]</sup></a> saying——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em> thus at last having particularly, treated of
all the distinct and different <i>sorts</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>,
to which the <i>Woman</i> can be subject; I come now in
the <i>next place</i>, to address my self to <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Her</em></span>, who was
never yet capable of any <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Conception</em></span>; and <i>that</i>
in the <i>Chapter</i> and <i>Manner following</i>, viz.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> IX.</span><br /> <i>Of the</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sterility</em></span> <i>or</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Barrenness</em></span> <i>of</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Women</em></span>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sterility</em></span> is in it self a <i>Præternatural
Faculty</i>, so I cannot but think, that, in the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Class</em></span> of <i>Præternatural Conceptions</i>, that of a <i><em class='gesperrt'>NON-CONCEPTION</em></i>
may at last pertinently take
place.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> I remember the <i>Reader</i> was referred to this
<i>Place</i>, by Sect. II. Chap. 5. where I promised to expound
the unsuccessful <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Act</em></span> of <i>Copulation</i>; as I
there briefly did the <i>Reverse-Case</i>: And after having
all a long <i>thus</i> far forward, safely conducted the <i>Fertile</i>
or <i>Fruitful</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span>, thro’ the different <i>Trains</i> and
<i>Consequences</i> of the successful <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Act</em></span>, I have left <i>Her</i> in a
safe <i>Condition</i>, together with the <i>Dear</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pledge</em></span> of
her <i>Natural Fœcundity</i>; whilst in the next place, I
come now to treat of the <i>Præternatural <em class='gesperrt'>BARREN
WOMAN</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> order to which, I <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span> observe, that the
<i>Jews</i>, and almost all other <i>Nations</i>, deemed it the
greatest <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mark</em></span> of <i>Infamy</i> imaginable, for a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span>,
<i>to yield no Children</i>; as is evident from the <i>Scriptures</i>,
how <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hagar</em></span>, <i>the fruitful Chamber-Maid</i>,<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c017'><sup>[219]</sup></a> <i>despised</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sarah</em></span>, <i>her barren Mistress</i>, &amp;c. But moreover——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, We may observe, that, upon
every provoking Occasion, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lord</em></span> <i>himself threatned
them with this Curse</i>; as <i>one</i> of the greatest <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Instances</em></span>
of his heavy <i>Displeasure</i>, and <i>One</i> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>the severest <i>Judgments</i>, that his <i><em class='gesperrt'>VENGEANCE</em></i>
could inflict on them for their <i>Sins</i>, as is also manifest
from repeated <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Instances</em></span> of <i>Scripture</i>, particularly
from the Words of the <i>Holy Prophet</i>, saying,<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c017'><sup>[220]</sup></a>
<i>They sowe the Wind</i>, <i>and shall reap the Whirlwind</i>:
<i>Their Glory shall fly away from the <em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em>: Their
Root is dryed up, they shall bear no Fruit</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIRDLY</em>, We may easily conclude that, such
a <i>Sentence</i> passing from the Mouth of the most high
<i><em class='gesperrt'>JUDGE</em></i>, the Supreme <i>Physician</i>, and <i>Omnipotent</i>
himself, could never be revers’d by the <i>Art</i> or <i>Ingenuity</i>
of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Man</em></span>: But as <i>Christians</i> have no Reason to
suspect themselves to lay under this accursed <i>Sentence</i>,
so they may well look nearer <i>Home</i>, and take a view
of the many different mediate and immediate <i>Causes</i> of
<i><em class='gesperrt'>STERILITY</em></i> or <i><em class='gesperrt'>NON-CONCEPTION</em></i> in
them.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOURTHLY</em>, however, before I enter upon <i>these</i>,
I would previously have it noted, that, sometimes the
<i>Fault</i>, or <i>Cause</i> of the <i>Woman’s not conceiving</i>, lies in
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Man</em></span>; and may proceed from many diverse <i>Diseases</i>
or <i>Symptoms</i> in him, as particularly mentioned,
and treated of at large,<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c017'><sup>[221]</sup></a> by the most Learned <i>Senertus</i>,
to which we refer the <i>Curious</i>; Because we
have nothing to do with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Man</em></span> in this place:
Wherefore that I may return to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span>, I
say——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> immediate <i>Causes</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>STERILITY</em></i> in her,
are manifest from the very <i>Definition</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>CONCEPTION</em></i>:
Which, according to <i>Galen</i>,<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c017'><sup>[222]</sup></a> is nothing
else, than <i>a Comprehension of <em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em> in the
Womb, for the Generation of Man</i>. But here it may
be requisite, to explain this general <i>Term</i> of Comprehension,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>which I would have understood to imply
<i>four particular Qualities</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, <i>viz.</i> <i>Attraction</i>,
<i>Retention</i>, <i>Distribution</i>, and <i>Fomentation</i>. Hence it is
that such <i>Women</i> must needs be <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Barren</em></span>, as cannot
either <i>attract</i> the effused; or <i>retain</i> the attracted;
or <i>distribute</i> and <i>alterate</i> the retain’d <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i> through
the Parts of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, and excite its latent <i>Virtue</i>
to <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Action</em></span>; or lastly, such as cannot duly foment
and nourish the same <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i>, when regularly
<i>distributed</i>; and <i>These</i>, I think, are all the immediate
<i>Causes</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>BARRENNESS</em></i>: As <i>Those</i>, for which
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i> either cannot be <i>attracted</i>, or <i>retained</i>,
or <i>distributed</i>, or <i>fomented</i>, are the mediate
<i>Causes</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>STERILITY</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em>, as to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span> of <i>These</i> then, the <i>Attraction</i>,
or the <i>attractive Faculty</i>, may fail in its Duty <i>two
ways</i>, viz. either because of its own <i>Debility</i>; or because
of some præternatural <i>Impediment</i>. The <i>Debility</i>
or <i>Imbecility</i> of this Faculty may proceed either
from a <i>Defect of Spirits</i> in the <i>Seminal Vessels</i>; or from
either of the <i>Intemperatures</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, whether
<i>Natural</i> or <i>Adventitious</i>: And <i>Impediments</i> may happen
in <i>Attraction</i> many different ways, such as by a
læs’d or extinct <i>Venereal Appetite</i>; by the <i>Woman’s
Aversion</i> or <i>Indifference</i> to her <i><em class='gesperrt'>MATE</em></i>; by the
perverse <i>Affections</i> of the Mind, such as <i>Melancholy</i>, <i>Grief</i>,
<i>Anger</i>, <i>Fear</i>, &amp;c. by <i>Causes</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Vagina</em></span>, or
<i>Orifice</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; by a <i>Coalescence</i>, <i>Ulcer</i>, <i>Membrane</i>,
<i>Carnous</i> or <i>Scirrhous Substance</i>, or any other kind
of <i>Tumours</i>; as also by a <i>Constriction</i>, <i>Distortion</i>, or
<i>Compression</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>ORIFICE</em></i>; or at last by too much
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fat</em></span>, <i>&amp;c.</i><a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c017'><sup>[223]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, the <i>Retentive Faculty</i> may come
short of its Duty <i>three different ways</i>; namely, either
because of its own <i>Imbecillity</i>, or because of some
<i>Præternatural Impediments</i>; or because of the <i>Object</i> it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>self. The <i>Imbecillity</i> or <i>Impotency</i> of this Faculty may
proceed either from the <i>Intemperature</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>;
or from the Abundance of some slimy <i>Mucous Humour</i>
in the same: And its <i>Impediments</i> may happen
from a <i>Prolapsus</i>, an <i>Inflammation</i>, an immoderate
<i>Flux</i>, the <i>Whites</i>, a <i>Gonorrhæa</i>, <i>Worms</i>, <i>Scirrhous</i>, or other
<i>Tumours</i>, <i>Ulcers</i>, or the <i>Cicatrix</i> of an old <i>Sore</i>
in the Body of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; as also from the Amplitude
or Laxity of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Orifice</em></span>, whether <i>Natural</i>
or <i>Adventitious</i>: Which <i>Accident</i> frequently happens
even to <i>Child-bearing Women</i>, sometimes by an <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Abortion</em></span>,
sometimes by a difficult <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Birth</em></span>, and
sometimes also by the rude <i>Usage</i> of an ignorant <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Midwife</em></span>,
that they can <i>never more Conceive</i>, until they
be duly <i>Cured</i>: Again, the <i>Cause</i> may be in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Object</em></span>,
or <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span> it self; when it is either <i>impure</i>,
<i>acrid</i>, <i>vitious</i>, and disagreeable to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; or
deprived of its natural <i>Heat</i> and <i>Spirits</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIRDLY</em>, the <i>Distributive</i> or <i>Alterative Faculty</i>
may be also impugned in its <i>Function</i>, <i>1st</i>, by its own
<i>Debility</i>, occasion’d by either of the <i>Diseases</i>, or <i>Intemperatures</i>
above-mentioned; or 2dly, by the discording
<i>Qualities</i> of the <i>Seminal Matter</i>; or 3dly, by
some certain Disproportion betwixt that <i>Matter</i> and
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> it self: Since as all <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seeds</em></span> do not answer
alike in <i>one Field</i>, some requiring a Pinguid and
Loose <i>Soil</i>, others a Lean and Slender <i>Ground</i>; so it
is with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> and the injected <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i>: For,
however fruitful the <i>One</i> may be, if the <i>other</i> be not
of a proportionable <i>Fœcundity</i>, no <i><em class='gesperrt'>CONCEPTION</em></i>
can possibly follow: Hence it is that many <i>Women</i>
have been accounted <i><em class='gesperrt'>BARREN</em></i> in their first <i>Marriage</i>,
who have had several <i>Children</i> to a <i>second Husband</i>.
Again, as <i>some <em class='gesperrt'>SEEDS</em></i> perish and are quite
lost in <i>moist</i>, <i>clayish</i>, or <i>marshy Ground</i>, and <i>others</i>
decay and are burnt up in an <i>Acrid</i>, <i>Sandy</i>, or <i>Gravelly
Field</i>; So it is also with the Human <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i>: For,
in the too <i>cold</i>, or <i>moist</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, it is extinguished,

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOURTHLY</em>, the Fomentation, or the <i>Nutritive
Faculty</i> may be deficient in its Office of <i>attracting
sufficient Aliment</i> to foment and nourish the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span>;
which however, is most commonly occasion’d by
Want, or Scarcity of <i>Blood</i> in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, proceeding
from <i>perverse Evacuations</i>, <i>Penury</i> or <i>Necessity</i>,
an <i>Atrophia</i>, <i>Consumption</i>, or the like, or then, in
fine, by the <i>Impurity</i>, or <i>vicious quality</i> of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> These, I think, are all the most common, as
well as the most prevalent <i>Causes</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sterility</em></span>:
Tho’, according to <i>Johannes Anglicus</i>, there are also
several <i>external Causes</i><a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c017'><sup>[225]</sup></a>; which however, I shall here
pass by in Silence; lest, as some good <i>Women</i> are at
great Pains to rectify their <i>barren Wombs</i>, <i>others</i> should
thereby take Sinistrous Measures to suppress their <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fertility</em></span>.
And in this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Class</em></span> may be included the
<i>Medicines</i> call’d by the <i>Greeks</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φθόυα</span>, because they are endued
with certain <i>occult Qualities</i>, which extinguish the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i> and obstruct the <i><em class='gesperrt'>CONCEPTION</em></i><a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c017'><sup>[226]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HAVING</em> thus defin’d the mediate and immediate
<i>Causes</i> of reputed <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sterility</em></span>, I can scarce,
because of either of <i>these</i>, call a <i>Woman</i> really
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Barren</em></span>; Since I have known some of the most
difficult of <i>these Cases</i> to have been duly <i>cur’d</i>, and
diverse <i>Women</i> to have conceiv’d, after many Years
<i><em class='gesperrt'>BARRENNESS</em></i>, and prov’d the Joyful <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mothers</em></span>
of hopeful <i>Children</i>; of which I could give
some signal <i>Instances</i>, if I took Pleasure in swelling
this <i>Work</i>: Hence it is, that the great Philosopher and
Physician, <i>Daniel Senertus</i>, only disswades the <i>Ingenuous</i>
from undertaking this <i>Cure</i>, in the Cases of vicious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span><i>Hereditary Dispositions</i>, venenated <i>Constitutions</i>, or other

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, we find that the very best of the
<i>Ancients</i> have been at great Pains, in distinguishing
exactly the <i>curable</i>, from the <i>incurable</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Barren
Womb</em></span>: Yea <i>Hippocrates</i>, <i>Galen</i>, &amp;c. have given
certain Directions, founded upon the solid <i>Truths</i> of
their Immense Knowledge and Heavenly Wisdom, to
try and discover the <i>One</i> from the <i>Other</i>; as <i>they</i> have
also taught us to Judge of every particular <i>Cause</i> affecting
the <i>Curable</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>. But to facilitate these
Nice <i>Discoveries</i>, I shall subjoin some few <i>Diagnostick
Signs</i>; because except we know the particular <i>Cause</i>,
we can never pretend to remove it, and without removing
the <i>Cause</i>, the <i>Effect</i> can never cease, or be
<i>cured</i>. Not but that——</p>

<p class='c005'>I <em class='gesperrt'>KNOW</em>, that the ingenious <i>Physician</i>, undertaking
this <i>Cure</i>, requires none of my <i>Instructions</i>;
which notwithstanding, I hope, He will allow me to
prosecute my Method in treating of <i>this Case</i>, as I
have done of some <i>others</i>; and <i>that</i> the rather, considering
it is generally well known, that sometimes <i>a
Fool has put a Wise Man in the right way</i>. Wherefore
I heartily wish that some Word may drop from my
<i>Pen</i>, that may prove instrumental to wipe off the imputed
<i>Blemishes</i>, and promote the real <i>Glory</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Women</em></span>;
And <i>this</i> I could wish the more, because I am
fully convinced that many are ignominiously branded
with <i><em class='gesperrt'>BARRENNESS</em></i>, without any sufficient <i>Cause</i>:
Insomuch, that I verily believe, that, upon an ingenuous
<i>Tryal</i>, not one real or incurable <i><em class='gesperrt'>BARREN
WOMB</em></i>, would be found in <i>Ten</i> of <i>those</i>, which are
this Day so reputed. But <i>à propos</i>——</p>

<p class='c005'>As I have reduced all the <i>Causes</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>STERILITY</em></i>
to the above said <i>four <em class='gesperrt'>CLASSES</em></i>, so I shall reduce
the <i>Diagnosticks</i> to the same number; and thereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>demonstrate how it may be easily discover’d, whether
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fault</em></span> lies in the <i>Attractive</i>, <i>Retentive</i>, <i>Alterative</i>,
or in the <i>Nutritive Faculty</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; and
how every particular <i>Cause</i> in any of <i>these</i> may be
plainly distinguished, <i>&amp;c.</i> In order to which, then—</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>TOUCHING</em> the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inquirendum est primò,

procul dubio in Attractrice hæret; ut etiam, si statim
à Coitu, aut post breve Intervallum semen effluat</span>.</i> I say,
<i>These</i> are the infallible <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Marks</em></span> of a læs’d <i>Attractive
Power</i>, which also denote some <i>Fault</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>,
such as an <i>oblique Situation</i>, a <i>Compression</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Epiploon</em></span>
or <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Cawl</em></span>, or some <i>obdurated Substance</i>,
impeding the <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i> to reach the Cavity of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>: The <i>Particular</i> of which is easily to be
discover’d; the <i>Situation</i> by the ingenious <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Touch</em></span>;
the <i>Compression</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Omentum</em></span> or <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Epiploon</em></span>
happens only to <i>Fat Women</i>; the <i>Substance</i> or <i>Tumour</i>
(of whatsoever kind) if not found in the <i>Passage</i>,
lodges in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> it self.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, If the <i>Party labours</i> under any of
the aforesaid <i>Causes</i> debilitating or impeding the <i>Retentive</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Power</em></span>; <i>some</i> are manifest to the <i>Woman</i> her
self; as in the <i>Cases</i> of any immoderate <i>Flux</i>, a <i>slimy</i>
or <i>illuvious Evacuation</i>, a <i>Gonorrhæa</i>, the <i>Whites</i>, a
<i>Falling</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>others</i> are obvious to the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Midwife’s</em></span> <i>Touch</i>, as in the <i>Case</i> of <i>Tumours</i>, <i>Ulcers</i>,
&amp;c. and in <i>Case</i> of either <i>Intemperature</i>, <i>Dropsy</i>,
<i>Inflammation</i>, <i>Worms</i>, &amp;c. all such are abundantly
evident to the <i>Physician</i>, after duly examining, and
considerately weighing the <i>Disposition</i> or <i>Temperature</i>
of the whole Body <i>in general</i>, and of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> in
<i>particular</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIRDLY</em>, if the <i>Alterative</i> or <i>altering Faculty</i>
be læs’d or impotent, then, after some Days <i>Retention</i>,
an <i>Effluxion</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i> happens, and that either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>because of some <i>Intemperature</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; or of
some discording <i>Quality</i> in the <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEEDS</em></i>, or in the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, as above; or lastly, because of a <i>Want</i> or
<i>Scarcity</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span> for forming the <em class='gesperrt'>FOETUS</em>. As
to the <i>Intemperatures</i>, I have already observ’d, that,
they may be readily distinguished by the ingenious
<i>Physician</i>; But the <i>Disproportion</i> betwixt the commixed
<i><em class='gesperrt'>SEEDS</em></i>, or between <i>these</i> and the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, how
much, and in what they may differ <i>one</i> from <i>another</i>,
is not so easily known; because this <i>Fault</i> may be as
much in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Man</em></span>, or perhaps more, than in the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span>, as has been already hinted: In this <i>Case</i>,
the <i>Physician</i> is to weigh and consider well the <i>Temperatures</i>
of the whole Body, and especially <i>that</i> of the
<i>Genital Parts</i> of both the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Man</em></span> and the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Wife</em></span>; and
as much as possible, to reduce <i>that</i> of the <i>One</i>, to the
more convenient <i>Temperature</i> of the <i>Other</i>,<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c017'><sup>[228]</sup></a> correcting
<i>Both</i> in what may be found requisite; according
to the Direction of <i>Lucretius</i>, in these <i>Verses</i>:</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FOURTHLY</em> and lastly, if the <i>Nutritive Faculty</i>
be faulty, the <i>Case</i> is plain and manifest; since it generally
proceeds from one or more of the following
<i>Causes</i>, <i>viz.</i> from <i>Want</i> or <i>Penury</i>; a <i>Pining away</i> or
<i>Consumption</i>; immoderate <i>Hæmorrhagies</i>, whether happening
by <i>Superiour</i> or <i>Inferiour Parts</i>; hard <i>Labour</i>;
too much <i>Fat</i>, or too much <i>Leanness</i>: As the same
may also happen from an <i>Obstruction</i> or <i>Suppression</i> of
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Menstruous Course</em></span>; or from its
vicious or impure <i>Quality</i>; and, in fine, from any severe
<i>Symptom</i> or <i>Disease</i> whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span><em class='gesperrt'>THUS</em> having discover’d the genuine and precise
<i>Causes</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sterility</em></span>, the <i>Cure</i> is as good as half
perfected; but that it may be altogether and effectually
perform’d, the next thing requisite in this place,
would be to treat of every <i>Cause</i> and its respective
<i>Cure</i> particularly;<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c017'><sup>[229]</sup></a> but as these do chiefly belong to
the <i>Diseases</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pudendum</em></span>, <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Vagina</em></span>, and
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; which I have already declin’d entring upon
at this time, for the <i>Reasons</i> mentioned in Sect. VI.
Chap. VI. I shall here only add in <i>general Terms</i>, that
tho’ the <i>barren</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> is justly compar’d to an insipid,
ungrateful, or unfruitful <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Field</em></span>, because neither the
<i>one</i> nor the <i>other</i> produces any thing <i>Good</i> of it self:
Yet as we see the <i>barren Lands</i> emproved and become
fruitful by the <i>Industry</i> of the <i>Husband-Man</i>; and
even <i>wild Roots</i> and <i>barren Trees</i> in time produce plentifully
by the Care and Diligence of the <i>Gardener</i>;
So the Heavenly <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Art</em></span> of <i>Physick</i> exerts it self strenuously
in improving the <i>barren</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, miraculously
supplying the <i>Defects</i>, and regularly correcting the
<i>Defaults</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nature</em></span>; restoring or replenishing it
with a desirable and grateful <i>Fœcundity</i>: I say, as
convenient <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Dung</em></span> comforts the <i>sterile Field</i>, so does
proper <i>Physick</i> the <i>barren</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; It elevates the low
and renovates the exhal’d <i>Spirits</i>; It vanquishes the
<i>Imbecility</i>, and corroborates the <i>Nerves</i>; It reduces the
<i>languid Heat</i>, and all the <i>Intemperatures</i> of the <i>genital
Parts</i>, to their respective, due and natural <i>Temperaments</i>;
removing naturally all <i>Obstructions</i>, and wonderfully
curing all the <i>Causes</i> hindering or withstanding
the <i>Procreation</i> of <i>Humane</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Race</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span><em class='gesperrt'>AND</em>, in fine, because proper <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Diet</em></span> is of great
Service to alter the <i>elementary Qualities</i>, and to convert
the <i>Bad</i> into a <i>Good Habit</i> or Body; such <i>Women</i>
are to be carefully directed to such a Judicious <i>Regimen</i>
of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Diet</em></span> and otherways, as is most efficacious and
convenient for their Purpose, either of <i>Health</i> or <i>Generation</i>.
Now having so far prosecuted my Design,
with respect to the <i>Barren</i>, as well as the <i>Fruitful</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span>; I, at present, take Leave of <i>Both</i>, and

of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Maiden</em></span>, as well as of the

to all the <i>Affections</i> of the <i>One</i>, as well

Tho’, in the mean time, I must also acknowledge, that,
<i>Those</i> which I am now about to touch upon, may

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> which Consideration, I hope the following

that the <i>others</i>, I mean the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Maid</em></span> and the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Wife</em></span>, may

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> II.</span><br /> <i>Of the</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hysterick Passion</em></span>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>WELL</em> might the excellent <i>Democritus</i> write to
his <i>Scholar</i>, the far more excelling <i>Hippocrates</i>,
that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> is the <i>Source of Six Hundred Griefs</i>, and
the <i>Spring of innumerable Sorrows to the</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span>:
Because of the manifest <i>Sympathy</i> or <i>Affinity</i>, which
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> has with almost all the other <i>Parts</i> of
the Body. And as we may reasonably conclude from
such an <i>Affinity</i>, that these <i>Symptoms</i> must needs be
both <i>Numerous</i> and <i>Different</i> in Kind; so I think, for
the same Reason, they may be <i>All</i> pertinently comprehended
under the <i>General Title</i> of <i>Hysterick Maladies</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> before we enter upon the Particulars of these
<i>Uterine Affections</i>, it may be first requisite to make
out the <i>Reality</i> of this <i>Affinity</i> or <i>Consent</i>; which will
be no difficult Matter, when we consider <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span>,
the <i>three Principles</i>, in which the same consists, <i>viz.</i>
in a <i>Similitude of Parts</i>; in a <i>Vicinity of Parts</i>; and in
a <i>Connexion of Vessels</i>. <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Secondly</em></span>, how by
<i>these</i>, as the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> is a <i>Membranous Substance</i>, it
has a Substantial <i>Affinity</i> with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Membranes</em></span>:
And by its <i>Vicinity</i>, with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Bladder</em></span>, <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Rectum</em></span>,
and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Intestines</em></span>; As by its <i>Veins</i>, <i>Arteries</i>, and
<i>Nerves</i>, it has with almost all the other <i>Parts</i> of the Body;
such as with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Brain</em></span>, by <i>Veins</i> and <i>Arteries</i>,
as well as by the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nerves</em></span> and <i>Spinal</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Membranes</em></span>;
with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Heart</em></span>, by <i>Arteries</i>; with
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Liver</em></span>, by <i>Veins</i>; with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stomach</em></span>, by
certain <i>Anastomoses</i>, betwixt the <i>Veins</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>,
and those of the <i>Mesentery</i>, as well as by <i>Arteries</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Spleen</em></span> by <i>Arteries</i>; with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Breasts</em></span>,
partly by <i>Veins</i>,<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c017'><sup>[230]</sup></a> and partly by <i>Nerves</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> it is that I can scarce find any <i>Part</i> of
the Body, which may not be affected by the <i>Indispositions</i>
of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; the <i>Heart</i>, the <i>Diaphragm</i>,
the <i>Head</i>, the <i>Brain</i>, and consequently all the <i>Organs</i>
of Sense and Motion, the <i>Liver</i>, the <i>Spleen</i>, the <i>Ventricle</i>,
the <i>Mesentery</i>, the <i>Belly</i>, the <i>Bladder</i>, the <i>Rectum</i>,
the <i>Back</i>, the <i>Loins</i>, the <i>Thighs</i>, the <i>Legs</i>, the <i>Arms</i>,
&amp;c. All which <i>Parts</i> are from thence subject to innumerable
various <i>Symptoms</i>, which commonly come
and go by <i>Periods</i>, after the manner of <i>Convulsive</i>,
or <i>Epileptick</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fits</em></span>, to which the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hysterical</em></span>
have also a very near Relation; in that the <i>Circulation</i>
and <i>Recourse</i> of all the <i>Three</i>, and some more such,
<i>Distempers</i> agree exactly, sometimes with the <i>Course</i> of
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span>, and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sun</em></span>, and sometimes with the
very <i>Motion</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sea</em></span>; and as <i>these</i> vary, so the

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THESE</em> Things are also most Judiciously made
out by the excellent Dr. <i>Mead</i>, saying, that, <i>the New

certain <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Boy</em></span> of a Year old, who every <i>Flood-Tide</i>,
was taken with <i>Convulsive</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fits</em></span>, and every <i>Ebb</i>
came to himself again<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c017'><sup>[233]</sup></a>. Which <i>Influence</i> of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sea</em></span>, no doubt depends upon the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span>’s approaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>our <i>Vertical Point</i>, or <i>that</i> directly opposite,
as the <i>Flood</i> encreases and comes to its <i>Height</i>, Moreover
again,——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>CONSIDERING</em> the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, not only as the
<i>Center</i>, in which the vitious <i>Humours</i> are accumulated
from all the other <i>Parts</i>, but also as the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pump</em></span> of
the <i>Body</i>, we may readily conclude that as long as it
regularly ejects the <i>Menstruous Blood</i>, it does at the
same time duly evacuate together with it, all those <i>Humours</i>
of whatsoever sort they be: Whereas we may
easily conceive that whatever obstructs or impedes the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> in any of its natural <i>Functions</i>, may occasion
various <i>Symptoms</i> to the <i>Woman</i>: However the most
of <i>these</i>, as well as the most dangerous, take their
<i>Origin</i> from the <i>Retention</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span> and the <i>suppression</i>
of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Menstrua</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Menstruous Blood</i> flowing in a natural Course
to the <i>Uterine Veins</i>, when its <i>Passage</i> is so obstructed,
that it cannot break forth; whether in <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Virgins</em></span>,
because of the <i>Astriction</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Orifices</em></span>; or in
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Widows</em></span>, because of the <i>Thickness</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span>,
or of any other gross viscid <i>Humour</i>; in these
<i>Cases</i>, it must of course regorge thro’ the <i>Branches</i> of
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Vena Cava</em></span> and the great <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Artery</em></span>, to
the <i>Head</i>, <i>Heart</i>, <i>Liver</i>, and <i>Veins</i> of the <i>Midriff</i>;
whence of Consequence proceed various <i>Symptoms</i> in
all these and their dependent <i>Parts</i>: Which notwithstanding,
I take the too long retain’d <span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></span> to occasion
the more dangerous and severe <i>Symptoms</i> to the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in <i>Case</i> of either of <i>These</i>, namely, either
the <i>Seminal</i>, or the <i>Menstruous Matter</i>, beginning to
corrupt, and consequently to acquire malignant <i>Qualities</i>,
then they produce divers most severe and dreadfull
<i>Symptoms</i>; and <i>that</i> not only in different <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patients</em></span>,
but also sometimes in <i>one</i> and the <i>same
Woman</i>; and not only at <i>different Times</i>, but also
sometimes at <i>one</i> and the <i>same Time</i>: However these
Things always happen, according to the different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span><i>Quantity</i> and <i>Quality</i> of the corrupted <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Humours</em></span>,
as well as according to the <i>Constitution</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>,
in which the <i>Corruption</i> succeeds. Again more particularly——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> the Malignant <i>Vapours</i> arising hence, penetrate
to the <i>Heart</i>, (the principal <i>Organ</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Life</em></span>, as well as
of the <i>Circulation</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span>) I would observe,
that, they occasion vellicating <i>Palpitations</i>, as also a
<i>Dejection of Spirits</i>, and <i>Anxiety of Mind</i>, attended
with frequent <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lypothymies</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Syncopes</em></span>:
If to the <i>Diaphragm</i> and <i>Lungs</i>, a <i>Difficulty</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Breathing</em></span>,
attended (as it were) with <i>Suffocations</i> or
<i>Strangulations</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Matter</em></span> ascends to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Head</em></span>, and
diffuse it self thro’ the <i>external Parts</i>, diverse grievous
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pains</em></span> assail the <i>Woman</i>, and <i>that</i> very differently;
insomuch, that, sometimes the <i>whole</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Head</em></span> is (as it
were) tortured, and sometimes but in <i>Part</i>; sometimes
on the <i>right</i>, and sometimes on the <i>left Side</i>;
sometimes in the <i>hind Part</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Head</em></span>, or
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Crown</em></span>, and sometimes in the <i>Fore-Head</i> or about
the <i>Eyes</i>: Whereas if it tend to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Brain</em></span>, and
distribute it self among the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Organs</em></span> of <i>Sense</i> and
<i>Motion</i>, both the internal and external <i>Senses</i> must
needs suffer accordingly; upon which the poor <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span>
is not only taken with an <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Aphonia</em></span> for
<i>Want of Speech</i>, but also with a Helpless or Senseless
Stupidity; and moreover, not only seiz’d with a <i>Resolution</i>
or <i>Debility</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hands</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Feet</em></span>, but also
with <i>Trembling</i> and <i>Convulsive Fits</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> the <i>same</i> ascends to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Liver</em></span>, the whole
<i>Habit</i> or <i>Constitution</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Body</em></span> is perverted: For
as the <i>vitious Humours</i> are easily communicated from
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> by the <i>Veins</i> to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Liver</em></span>, so the
affected <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Liver</em></span> again readily diffuses its <i>Infection</i> by
the <i>Veins</i> to the whole <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Body</em></span>. If to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Spleen</em></span>
and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mesentery</em></span>, <i>Murmurings</i>, <i>Pains</i> and <i>Torments</i>
arise in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Belly</em></span>; which are commonly attended
with a <i>Pain</i> in the left <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Side</em></span> and left <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Breast</em></span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>extending it self to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Jugulum</em></span>, or fore-part of
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Neck</em></span>, Difficulty of <i>Breathing</i>, frequent <i>Belchings</i>,
a siccid bound <i>Belly</i>, and all the other <i>Symptoms</i>
which usually are the <i>Concomitants</i> of the <i>Hypocondriack
Affection</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Ventricle</em></span>, thence proceed <i>Fastidy</i>,
<i>Pica</i>, <i>Vomitings</i>, <i>Pains</i> and <i>Gnawings</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stomach</em></span>,
<i>Sobbings</i>, <i>Yawnings</i>, <i>Belchings</i>, &amp;c. But, and if
the said <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Matter</em></span> distributes it self thro’ the whole
<i>Circuit</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Body</em></span>, then the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span> is frequently
seiz’d, sometimes with a sudden <i>red</i>, and sometimes
with a <i>pale Colour</i>; as also sometimes with a
<i>sudden Heat</i>, and <i>Ardour</i> in her <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Face</em></span>, which she
commonly perceives or feels to vanish and go off as
suddenly: Again she is sometimes also taken with
<i>sudden Cold</i>, and sometimes with as <i>sudden hot Fits</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> all which, it evidently appears, how justly
<i>Galen</i> says<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c017'><sup>[234]</sup></a>, that the <i>Hysterick Passion</i> (under one Appellation)
comprehends innumerable various <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Symptoms</em></span>:
Even so <i>many</i>, that at least (I think) they
cannot be possibly comprehended in this <i>Volume</i>,
which extorts another <i>Apology</i> from me in this Place;
namely and plainly, that as I have no Ambition to be
accounted any extraordinary <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Person</em></span> of great
<i>Learning</i> or <i>Reading</i>; so I far less desire to set up or
give my self out for <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>One</em></span> of <i>Universal Practice</i> or
<i>Experience</i>: And as at the <i>Beginning</i>, I only design’d
this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Book</em></span> for the immediate <i>Service</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Midwives</em></span>,
and the common Good of <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMEN</em></i> and
their <i><em class='gesperrt'>CHILDREN</em></i>, the <i>Poor</i>, I mean in general,
as well as the <i>Rich</i>; So I am yet resolv’d, rather, to
stifle or restrain my <i>Inclinations</i> for the present time,
and suppress what might be otherways pertinently
added on these <i>Subjects</i>, than to put it out of the reach
of the <i>Purchase</i> of either of <i><em class='gesperrt'>THOSE</em></i>. I say, for
these reasons, I shall not undertake at this time to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>enter upon every particular <i>Head</i> or <i>Branch</i> of the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>HYSTERICKS</em></i>; only that I may not be censur’d as
<i>Churlish</i> or <i>Peevish</i> to the more delicate <i><em class='gesperrt'>LADIES</em></i>,
and tenderly constituted <i>Women</i>, who always labour
and suffer most under these <i>Distempers</i>, I shall however
yet endeavour to discuss particularly the most <i>dangerous</i>,
as well as the most <i>common Case</i>, belonging to this
general <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Topick</em></span>; and not only so, but, according
to my <i>Ability</i>, I shall also endeavour in <i>it</i>, if possible
in a few words, to include and comprehend all
the rest of these <i>Female Indispositions</i>: And <i>that</i> to the
<i>Purpose</i>, and under the <i>Title</i>, following, <i>viz.</i>——</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='large'><em class='gesperrt'>CHAP.</em> III.</span><br /> <i>Of the Strangulation of the</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> preceding <i>Chapter</i> contains a general Account
of the sundry various <i>Hysterick Passions</i>,
together with their respective <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Symptoms</em></span>, as they
affect the chief and Principal <i>Parts</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Body</em></span>;
whence I might descend to a great <i>Variety</i> of <i>particulars</i>;
but as neither my present <i>Time</i> nor <i>Design</i>
will permit my entring upon <i>These</i> in this place, I
shall content my self with treating of <i>This</i> <i><em class='gesperrt'>ONE</em></i>;
which as it is the chief and most dangerous of all
the <i>Uterine Affections</i>, so ’tis the most <i>Universal</i> and
<i>Common</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> comprehends, in short, many various severe, and
even wonderful <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Symptoms</em></span> in it self; whence I conclude,
that, he who sufficiently understands the <i>present
Case</i> or <i>Condition</i>, may easily comprehend all the other
Circumstances, belonging to the foregoing <i>general
Head</i>; Since with whatever difference of <i>Symptoms</i>,
or <i>Diagnostick Signs</i>, they may appear, the <i>Causes</i> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span><i>Effects</i> are originally of the same <i>Nature</i>: For <i>This</i>
is the very <i>Affection</i> which <i>Galen</i><a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c017'><sup>[235]</sup></a> call’d the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ωνὶξ ὑσεικὴ</span>, that is, the <i>Hysterick Passion</i>, and he might
as well have said the <i>grand Hysterick Passion</i>: The
<i>Latins</i> call it <i>Strangulatio</i>, or <i>Suffocatio</i>, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Præfocatio
Uterina</span></i>; because in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fit</em></span>, the <i>Woman</i> seems to be
<i>Suffocated</i> or <i>Strangled</i> by the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>. But to the
Purpose,——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em> variously and copiously the Ancients
have defin’d this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Evil</em></span>, I think the few following
Words, may properly explain it, <i>viz.</i> <i>This
Suffocation is a Distemper of all the Natural, Vital, and
Animal Actions, proceeding many different ways, from an
ill or disaffected</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I say many <i>different ways</i>, according to the many
<i>different Sorts</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>AFFECTION</em></i>; because <i>One</i> is,
when the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Symptoms</em></span> of the <i>læs’d Natural Faculty</i>
only appear; in which the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i> labours under
<i>Inflations</i>, and frequent <i>Rumblings</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>BELLY</em></i>,
<i>Murmurings</i>, <i>Belchings</i>, <i>Pains</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stomach</em></span>,
<i>Anxiety</i>, <i>Uneasiness</i>, and sometimes <i>Vomitings</i>. <i>Another</i>
different <i><em class='gesperrt'>AFFECTION</em></i> is, when the <i>vital Faculty</i>
is læs’d or indisposed, in which the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i>
is not only taken with <i>Heart-Beatings</i>, but also with
<i>Faintings</i> and <i>Swooning-Fits</i>, with a small, frequent,
and unequal <i><em class='gesperrt'>PULSE</em></i>. A <i>Third</i> is when the <i>Animal
Faculty</i> is læs’d or disaffected, which may happen many
ways; and in this <i>Condition</i> the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span> is depriv’d
of <i>Motion</i> and all <i>external Sense</i>, however she retains
the principal <i>Functions</i>, together with her <i><em class='gesperrt'>PULSE</em></i>
and <i><em class='gesperrt'>BREATH</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AGAIN</em>, farther yet, there is <i>another Sort</i> of this
<i>Hysterick <em class='gesperrt'>AFFECTION</em></i>, in which the <i>Motion</i> is deprav’d,
turning to various <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Convulsions</em></span> of the
<i>Legs</i>, <i>Arms</i>, <i>Teeth</i>, <i>Lips</i>, <i>Eyes</i>, and so of the whole
Body. As also moreover, there is still <i><em class='gesperrt'>ONE</em></i>, or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span><i>Fifth</i> different <i>Sort</i> of this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Suffocation</em></span>, in
which all the <i>Faculties of Life</i> are seemingly abolished;
so far, that (according to common Sense and Apprehension)
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i> differs in Nothing from a
<i>dead Person</i>. Hence it has often happen’d, that such
<i>Women</i> (upon a mistake) have been imprudently
<i>buried</i> (for <i><em class='gesperrt'>DEAD</em></i>,) and sometimes had the good
Fortune to return from their <i>Graves</i> to their <i>Houses</i>
again; whereof many learned <i>Authors</i> give us remarkable
<i>Instances</i><a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c017'><sup>[236]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> if it should be ask’d, in short, how it is
possible for the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span> to <i>live</i>, after she has lost
both her <i><em class='gesperrt'>PULSE</em></i> and her <i><em class='gesperrt'>BREATH</em></i>? I can only
refer the Curious to <i>Galen</i>, who has fully answer’d
that <i>Question</i><a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c017'><sup>[237]</sup></a> (according also to the Sentiment of
<i>Heraclydes</i>) <i>viz.</i>——<i>That tho’ the Refrigeration of the
whole Body, and its principal Parts, is so great as to intercept
both the Pulse and the Breath; Yet the Woman,
no less than other Animals, such as Snails and others of
that kind, which live in strict obscurity, may have Transpiration
sufficient, thro’ the whole Circuit of the Body, to
defend <em class='gesperrt'>LIFE</em></i><a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c017'><sup>[238]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> so, then, that there are so many different <i>Sorts</i>
of <i><em class='gesperrt'>UTERINE STRANGULATIONS</em></i>, there
must also (of Consequence) be as many peculiar
<i>Causes</i>: Which, tho’ all take <i>Origin</i> from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>,
yet do not arise to this Pitch, unless <i>two other Causes</i>
concur with it. Viz. <i><em class='gesperrt'>ONE</em></i> from the <i>Part affected</i>;
<i><em class='gesperrt'>ANOTHER</em></i> from the <i>Passages</i>, thro’ which the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> communicates this <i><em class='gesperrt'>AFFECTION</em></i> to it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>But in short, the <i>principal immediate Causes</i> are <i><em class='gesperrt'>THREE</em></i><a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c017'><sup>[239]</sup></a>
viz. <i>retain’d Menstruous Blood</i>, <i>vitiated Seed</i>, <i>and
putrid Humours</i>, or <i>corrupted Matter</i>, contain’d in any
part of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>; which immediate, and concurring
<i>Causes</i>, I come now to Speak to, <i>viz.</i>——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AS</em> to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span> then, I think the <i>retain’d
<em class='gesperrt'>BLOOD</em></i>, is not sufficient of it self to induce this
<i><em class='gesperrt'>AFFECTION</em></i>, because we know, many to be free
from it, who yet labour under the <i>suppress’d <em class='gesperrt'>MENSTRUA</em></i>;
wherefore the <i>Imbecillity</i> of the <i>Principal
Parts</i> admitting the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Humours</em></span>, must concur with
the <i>Latitude</i> of the <i>Passages</i>, thro’ which the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span>
is communicated to them: Which <i>Three</i> conspiring
together, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Suffocation</em></span> of course succeeds
with Aggravation.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span> flows thro’ the <i>Veins</i> and <i>Arteries</i>,
into the <i><em class='gesperrt'>HEART</em></i>, it occasions a <i><em class='gesperrt'>SYNCOPE</em></i>,
which is a most severe <i>Affection</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> it ascends into the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Brain</em></span>, it occasions various
<i>Symptoms</i> according to the <i>Quality</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span>,
<i>viz.</i>——If it is <i>Pituitous</i>, it induces a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Suffocation</em></span>
with <i><em class='gesperrt'>SLEEP</em></i>, resembling a <i><em class='gesperrt'>LETHARGY</em></i>:
If it be <i>Bilious</i>, the <i><em class='gesperrt'>AFFECTION</em></i> is most furious,
and the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i> is (as it were) almost <i>Mad</i>,
tearing her self, pulling her <i>Hair</i>, renting her <i>Cloaths</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> If the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span> be <i>sweet</i>, she only fancies <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Amours</em></span>,
and meditates upon <i>pleasing</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Chimeras</em></span>:
As, in fine, if <i>Melancholick</i>, it seizes her with a <i>Sadness</i>
of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Heart</em></span>, and <i>Dejection</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mind</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> as to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Second</em></span> <i>Cause</i>, the <i>retain’d</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Seed</em></span> induces not only <i>These</i>, but more grievous
<i>Symptoms</i>, since as soon as it is <i>corrupted</i> and <i>refrigerated</i>,
it becomes the worst of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Poyson</em></span><a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c017'><sup>[240]</sup></a>: And as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>reaches the principal debilitated <i>Parts</i>, it draws on the
most dangerous <i>sort</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Suffocations</em></span>; in
which the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span> <i>lies for Dead</i>, the whole
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Body</em></span> being extremely refrigerated, or benumb’d by
this <i>venenated Matter</i>. Which Accident however may
happen promiscuously to <i>all Women</i>, abounding with
such <i>morbifick Contents</i> in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, as sometimes
falls out to <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Maids</em></span>, but more commonly to
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Widows</em></span>, whose <i>Bodies</i> as well as <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Wombs</em></span> abound
with <i>pituitous</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Humours</em></span>; as also sometimes
to <i>Pregnant Women</i> of <i>Cacochymical Habits</i>, and to <i>Puerperial
Women</i> not <i>cleansing</i> sufficiently.</p>

<p class='c005'>I know by the way, that some modern <i>Writers</i> define
the <i>Case</i> otherways, and will have <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Men</em></span> to be
also lyable to the same <i>Distemper</i>, which they alledge
proceeds chiefly from the <i>Blood</i> and <i>Spirits</i>: But the
<i>Reason</i> why I think <i>they</i> are exempted from it, at least
from its <i>Severities</i>, is because, what they <i>lose</i> in
<i>Nocturnal Pollutions</i> or otherways, is always ejected or
thrown <i>without Doors</i>; whereas what the <i>other</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sex</em></span>
so <i>emitts</i>, may be still retain’d <i>within</i>; and consequently
by a long <i>Detention</i> there, may be converted
into <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Venom</em></span>, or a <i>Poysonous Humour</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, this happens more readily and frequently
to <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Widows</em></span>, than to <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Virgins</em></span>, because
in the <i>one</i>, the Passages are not only dilated, but also
Nature is accustomed to such <i>Emissions</i>, as the <i>other</i> is
yet wholly a Stranger to. Moreover——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AGAIN</em>, this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Affection</em></span> may also proceed
from too great an <i>abundance</i> of <i><span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></span></i> in those, call’d
the <i>Seminal Vessels</i>; tho’ not to such a dangerous Degree:
In which <i>Case</i>, if the <i><span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></span></i> be <i>Acrimonious</i>, a <i>Convulsion</i>
may happen; if otherways, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span>
seems only to faint and fall away, with a sort of a
grateful <i>Indulgence</i>, without any great Change of
<i>Countenance</i>, or Alteration of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pulse</em></span>; tho’ she often
continues with her <i>Eyes</i> shut, Starting and Wakening
(as it were) frequently: And as upon returning to herself,
she falls <i>a-sighing</i>, so a little after, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Symptom</em></span>
recurs again.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span><em class='gesperrt'>FINALLY</em>, as to the <i>third Cause</i>, Supposing this
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Affection</em></span> to seize <i>Women</i>, who not only Purge
regularly, but are also satiated with <i>Virile Conversation</i>;
or, as it sometimes happens, to take <i>Old Women</i>:
In these <i>Cases</i>, the <i>Cause</i> is undoubtedly very different
from those mentioned, and proceeds either from
<i>Winds</i>, <i>Vapours</i>, or putrid and corrupted <i>Humours</i>, contain’d
in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, and communicated by various
<i>Passages</i>, to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Heart</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Brain</em></span>: And this
<i>Corruption</i> may readily succeed in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, because,
as <i>it</i> is a part very different from any other of
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Body</em></span>, endued with peculiar <i>Faculties</i>, so if it be
not well disposed, the vitious <i>Humours</i> may also corrupt
in it, after a peculiar manner; if not in its own <i>Cavity</i>,
in the <i>Uterine Vessels</i>, as most frequently happens.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> which, I observe that, if these <i>Winds</i> or
<i>Vapours</i> are communicated to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Heart</em></span>, thro’ the
<i>Veins</i> and <i>Arteries</i>, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Suffocation</em></span> happens
with <i>Palpitation</i>: If to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Brain</em></span>, with a <i>Vertigo</i>,
a <i>Tingling of the Ears</i>, and a <i>Suffusion</i> from the <i>Phantasms
of the Eyes</i>: Whereas, if the deprav’d <i>Humours</i> or
<i>Vapours</i>, ascend there, thro’ the <i>Nerves</i>, various <i>Convulsions</i>
happen; especially if the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Brain</em></span> abounds
also with <i>frigid Humours</i>. And <i>these</i>, in short, according
to the foresaid <i>Authorities</i>, are all the Proximous
and <i>immediate Causes</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hysterick
Passion</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HENCE</em> I come now to touch upon the <i>mediate
Causes</i> of the same <i>Distemper</i>, which may be easily
conceiv’d by any who understands <i>those</i> of the <i>suppressed</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Menstrua</em></span>, <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Gonorrhæa</em></span>, <i>&amp;c.</i> which
<i>Cases</i> I can by no means enter upon at this Time, for
the reasons mentioned in the last preceding <i>Chapter</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em></span> from what is said (I hope) this <i>Uterine</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Strangulation</em></span>, together with all its Differences,
may be easily distinguished by the ingenious
<i>Reader</i>. However yet, because all its <i>different Sorts</i>
have some degree of <i>Affinity</i>, with other diverse
<i>Symptoms</i>, which no ways proceed from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>I come now to propose some <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Signs</em></span> of <i>Distinction</i>,
first in <i>general</i>, and next in <i>particular</i>, viz.——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>general</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Signs</em></span> then are <i>Three</i>, by which I
think, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hysterick</em></span> may be readily distinguished
from all other <i>Affections</i>, namely,——</p>

<p class='c005'>I. <em class='gesperrt'>IT</em> is a <i>Muliebrian Disease</i>, and that only familiar
to some of the more <i>delicate Women</i>: When therefore
we know, from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span> herself, or from
those about her, that she is obnoxious to this <i>Affection</i>;
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hysteric</em></span> <i>Symptoms</i> also appearing, we need
not suspect any other Distemper. II. <i>Hysterical Women</i>
complain frequently of their <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Wombs</em></span> being ill-disposed,
and out of order. As, III. <i>They</i> are most
commonly helped and freed from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Paroxysm</em></span>,
by holding <i>Fœtids</i> to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nose</em></span>, and <i>Suaveolents</i> to the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pudendum</em></span>; which holds good in no other <i>Affection</i>.
But more particularly——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Distemper</i> differs from a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Syncope</em></span>, in
that, a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Syncope</em></span> is <i>precipitant</i>, and seizes the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span>
all at once, tho’ ’tis but of short <i>Duration</i>;
Whereas in <i>this</i>, some evident <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Signs</em></span> of an approaching
<i>Paroxysm</i> always precede, and the Evil continues
sometimes for several Hours and perhaps Days:
In <i>that</i>, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pulse</em></span> is quickly abolish’d, or at least
seemingly <i>ceases</i>; in <i>this</i>, it remains, however <i>small</i>,
except in the aforementioned extreme <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fit</em></span>: In <i>that</i>
of a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Syncope</em></span>, <i>cold Sweats</i> appear, and the <i>Countenance</i>
changes <i>pale</i>; and when the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Heart</em></span> is severely
affected, it may be probably conjoin’d with the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hysterick</em></span> <i>Affection</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> <i>This Distemper</i> differs also from an <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Epilepsy</em></span>:
For in <i>That</i> the <i>Convulsive Motions</i> are
not always join’d with it, or if they be, they are not
so <i>universal</i>, affecting only <i>one</i> or <i>other Member</i>: In
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Epilepticks</em></span>, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pulse</em></span> is greater than ordinary;
but in <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hystericks</em></span>, it is the <i>Reverse</i>:
In <i>that</i> the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span> <i>foams at the Mouth</i>, and loses
the principal <i>Functions</i> of Life, especially the <i>Memory</i>;
in <i>this</i> they <i>foam not</i>, neither commonly lose any <i>internal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>Sense</i>; but only awake like <i>those</i> who have been
asleep.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> <i>Affection</i> differs again from the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Apoplexy</em></span>,
in that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Parts</em></span> are not so much <i>affected</i>,
nor their feeling so much abolished; in <i>that</i>
there is no continual <i>Snoaring</i>, and the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pulse</em></span> is
only diminished and depraved, which in <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Apoplectics</em></span>
most commonly remains entire: In short,
the <i>one</i> is preceded, as well as accompany’d with
diverse <i>Symptoms</i>; whereas the <i>other</i> assails the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span>
suddenly, without any previous Notice or
<i>Signification</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>AGAIN</em> the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hystericks</em></span> differ from a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lethargy</em></span>;
in that <i>This</i> is attended with a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fever</em></span>;
<i>That</i> not at all: In <i>This</i> the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pulse</em></span> is raised higher
and is stronger; in <i>That</i> it falls always lower, and is
weaker.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, there are diverse <i>Experiments</i>,
mentioned by <i>Authors</i>, to distinguish a <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span>
in the extreme <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fit</em></span> of this <i>Passion</i>, from a Person
actually <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Dead</em></span>: Such as <i>Lint</i>, <i>Feathers</i>, or <i>burnt
Paper</i> being held to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mouth</em></span>; if moved,
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span> <i>breathes</i>. A <i>Glass of Water</i> being set
upon the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Breast</em></span>; if stirred, there is some
<i>Motion</i> and <i>Dilatation</i> still in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Breast</em></span>. Or, in
fine, a <i>Looking-Glass</i> well wiped, being held to their
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Mouths</em></span>, if infected, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span> is still
and certainly <i>alive</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, all <i>These Things</i>, I look upon to be
merely <i>trifling</i> and <i>uncertain</i> in this Case; because, supposing
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Woman</em></span> <i>not to breathe</i>, as has been hinted;
How then can she <i>expire</i> so much from her <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lungs</em></span>,
as to <i>move a Feather</i>, or <i>infect a Glass</i>? Or, how can
her <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Breast</em></span> have any such a <i>Motion</i>, as to move
<i>Water in a Glass</i>? Considering well, what has been
already said, that it is only by <i>internal Transpiration</i>,
that she draws the <i>Breath of Life</i>; which is neither
effected by the <i>Motion</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Breast</em></span>, nor the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Lungs</em></span>; but rather by a certain obscure and latent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span><i>Motion</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Heart</em></span>, and the internal <i>Arteries</i>:
In such manner, as some <i>Animals</i>, living in <i>Cells
of Obscurity</i>, seem to be refrigerated, or benumb’d and
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Dead</em></span> the whole <i>Winter-Season</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> in this <i>Case</i>, the more <i>certain Method</i> is, to
try the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span> with proper <i>Sternutatories</i>, such as
are otherways useful in all such <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Paroxysms</em></span>, for
if <i>alive</i>, she will be quickly mov’d by <i>Sternutation</i>:
As when the <i>Body</i> begins to send forth a <i>Cadaverous
Smell</i>, it is a certain <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sign</em></span> that the <i>innate Heat</i> is
extinct with the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Life</em></span>, and that the <i>Body</i> is no more
supported by the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Soul</em></span>. Wherefore the safest and
surest way is, not to <i>bury</i> such <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Persons</em></span>, before
the <i>Expiration of 72 Hours</i>, reckoning from the beginning
of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fit</em></span>: Because, if in this Time,
which is the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Crisis</em></span>, or <i>Term</i> of the <i>Circuit</i> of all
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Humours</em></span> in the Body, they do not <i>revive</i>,
there is no more Room left for <i>Hopes</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the next place, I come to mark the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Diagnosticks</em></span>,
whereby it may be best distinguished,
which of the before-mentioned <i>immediate Causes</i>,
gives <i>Rise</i> to the <i><em class='gesperrt'>HYSTERICK PASSION</em></i> in any
<i>Woman</i> labouring under the same <i>Malady</i>. And,
I. <em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> it proceeds from the <i>Menstruous Blood</i>, in this
<i>Condition</i>, the <i>Natural Course</i> must needs be suppress’d,
either in whole or in part: And the Difference of
the <i>Quality</i> of this <i><em class='gesperrt'>BLOOD</em></i>, is evident from the foregoing
<i>Symptoms</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>II. <em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> from too long <i>retain’d <em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i>; the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span>
is to be suppos’d regular in her <i>natural Flux</i>,
as she is <i>Calid</i> and <i>Sanguine</i>, either from <i>high Living</i>,
or <i>want of Exercise</i>: In <i>this</i> the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Symptoms</em></span> are all
more severe and dangerous, than in the <i>other Case</i>,
and upon the declension of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Paroxysm</em></span>, or
the <i>Fits</i> going off, a certain <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Humour</em></span> flows from
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pudendum</em></span>, occasion’d by the <i>Constriction</i>
made in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. <em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> from corrupted <i>Humours</i>, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span>
not only <i>Purges</i> regularly, but also enjoys her <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Husband</em></span>:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>Hence in this <i>Case</i>, I would conclude that
she either labours, or has labour’d under some <i>Uterine
Distemper</i>, such as a <i>Satyriasis</i>, <i>Pruritus</i>, <i>Furor</i>, <i>Gonorrhæa</i>,
<i>Fluor Muliebris</i>, <i>Ulcers</i>, <i>Impostumes</i>, a former
<i>Suppression</i>, or <i>Irregularity</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Menstrua</em></span>, or
the like: As also many <i>Learned Men</i> agree that a
<i>Præternatural Situation</i><a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c017'><sup>[241]</sup></a>, namely, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb’s</em></span> ascending
to the <i>superior Parts</i>, compressing the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Liver</em></span>
and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Diaphragma</em></span>, and consequently the <i>Lungs</i>,
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Heart</em></span>, or <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Stomach</em></span>, may induce various
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Suffocations</em></span>; Which, I think, is also confirm’d
by <i>Reason</i> and <i>Experience</i>. For——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHO</em> knows not that the <i>Ligaments</i> of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, may be so relaxed and extended, that it may
fall down to the very <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Knees</em></span>, as I have seen it?
And who may not thence conceive that in the same
<i>Laxity</i> of the <i>Ligaments</i>, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> may be as well
driven upwards by <i>Winds</i>, <i>Vapours</i>, or too much gross
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span> in the <i>Ligaments</i>; or by ungrateful <i>Odours</i>
approaching the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span>, as it may also be attracted
by pleasant and grateful <i>Smells</i> at the <i>Nose</i>? Not that
I mean here, by the by, that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> is capable
of <i>Smelling</i>, and therefore shuns disagreeable <i>Fœtors</i>;
but only that its <i>Spirits</i> and <i>Heat</i>, especially in <i>Those</i>,
who abound with deprav’d <i>Humours</i>, are attracted either
way by agreeable <i>Odours</i>, or fragrant <i>Smells</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em></span> in this <i>Case</i>, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> may be plainly
found by the <i>Touch</i>, ascended in the Form of a round
<i>Ball</i>; Which however may be easily brought down,
and replaced in its <i>natural Posture</i>, by any skilful experienced
<i>Hand</i>, previously well anointed with the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Oil</em></span> of <i>Spike</i>, <i>Spikenard</i>, <i>White Lillies</i>, or the like.
Again farther, to prevent its <i>Return</i>, some nauseous
<i>Smells</i>, may be apply’d to the <i>Nose</i>, or the <i>Reverse</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>to the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Pudendum</em></span>; as also the superiour <i>Parts</i> of
the Body may be tyed strait with proper <i>Bands</i> or
<i>Ligaments</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> more particularly, as to the proper <i>Diagnosticks</i>
of the imminent <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Paroxysm</em></span>, or approaching
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fit</em></span> of <i>Suffocation</i>, these are, <i>Grumblings</i> in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Abdomen</em></span>,
a <i>Distention</i> and <i>Pulsation</i> in the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Back</em></span>
and <i>Hypochondriacks</i>, a <i>Weariness</i> of the whole Body, an
<i>Imbecillity</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Legs</em></span>, <i>Belching</i>, <i>Nauseating</i>, <i>Gaping</i>,
a <i>pale Face</i>, and a <i>sad Countenance</i>; attended at
last with the aforesaid Sense of <i>Strangulation</i>, as if the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span> was a-swallowing a <i>Ball</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> As also I
have known <i>some Women</i> to have been taken with a
long <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fit</em></span> of <i>Laughter</i> upon this occasion, <i>others</i> with
that of <i>Crying</i>; as probably <i>some</i> may confusely <i>act
both</i> at once.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, It is to be observ’d in this place,
that, as the <i>Distemper</i> is not equally violent in <i>All</i>,
nor always attended by the <i>same</i>, or the same number
of <i>Symptoms</i>; so neither are the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fits</em></span> equally
long or frequent, but invade and seize the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span>
according to the quick or slow gathering of the <i>Morbifick
Humours</i>, which are also sooner or later discussed:
Which <i>Humorous Particles</i> in our Bodies,
like as in intermitting <i>Fevers</i>, have their due Times of
<i>Digestion</i>, <i>Accumulation</i>, and <i>Exaltation</i>; which <i>Height</i>
as soon as they have arrived to, they suddenly, and
as it were in a Moment, break out into <i>Action</i>: Or
else <i>These Humours</i> may lye dormant in the Body,
until by some <i>Procatarctick</i>, or <i>External Cause</i>, they are
exagitated, and set at <i>Work</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em></span> this <i>Agitation</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Humours</em></span> depends
not only upon the <i>Course</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sun</em></span> and <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span>,
but also sometimes more particularly upon the <i>Change</i>
of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Air</em></span>, and the <i>Motion</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sea</em></span>. As to the
<i>Solar</i> and <i>Lunar Influences</i> upon the <i>Animal Machine</i>,
they are already abundantly set forth<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c017'><sup>[242]</sup></a>, wherefore I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>shall resume Nothing of <i>them</i> in this place: And
as to the <i>Efficiency</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Air</em></span>, I would observe it to
be always most considerable about the <i>Two Equinoxes</i>;
as at these <i>Seasons</i> the most impetuous <i>Winds</i> and
violent <i>Storms</i> happen; and that continually the most
severe at <i>Noon</i> and <i>Midnight</i>; that is to say, when
the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sun</em></span> is in our <i>Zenith</i>, or in the <i>Nadir</i>, <i>viz.</i> in
the <i>vertical Point</i> over our <i>Heads</i>, or the quite <i>opposite</i>
under<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c017'><sup>[243]</sup></a> our <i>Feet</i>. These <i>Changes</i> however come a
little before the <i>Vernal Equinox</i>, but follow the <i>Autumnal</i>;
because of the various <i>Distances</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span>
in its <i>Perigæum</i> and <i>Apogæum</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>MOREOVER</em>, at these <i>Seasons</i>, and indeed at
all Times, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Air</em></span> swells or rises highest, at <i>New</i>
and <i>Full</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span>, from the conjunct Power of both
the <i>Planets</i>: Hence the diligent <i>Mariners</i> and <i>Husbandmen</i>
always observe the <i>Weather</i> to change, and
<i>Winds</i> to rise upon these Occasions; and, not only so,
but also, a constant and certain <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Recourse</em></span> of
<i>Winds</i> and <i>Weather</i> to happen at certain <i>Seasons</i> of the
Year; and <i>that</i> from some certain necessary <i>Natural
Cause</i>, which always acts in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c005'>As to the <i>Motion</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sea</em></span>, its Efficacy upon
the <i>Animal Fabrick</i>, may be easily comprehended, considering
only what is said; together with this Truth,
that, at all <i>Seasons</i>, the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Air</em></span> is highest, and the
<i>Winds</i> strongest, when the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Tide</em></span> of the <i>Flood</i> is at
its highest Ascent. For as the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sea</em></span> swells, so the
<i>Ambient</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Air</em></span> in 25 Hours, is twice raised to a considerable
great <i>Height</i>, from the <i>Attraction</i> of the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span> approaching the <i>Meridian</i>: And the same
swelling of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Air</em></span> must necessarily follow, as often
as the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sun</em></span> comes to the <i>Meridian</i> of any place, either
above or below the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Horizon</em></span>; tho’ (as aforesaid)
it is always <i>highest</i> at <i>New</i> and <i>Full</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span>: And
<i>lowest</i> of all, when the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span> is but half <i>Full</i>; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span><i>Planets</i> then drawing each a contrary way: As it is
<i>middling</i>, during the Time between the dimidiated
<i>Orbs</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span>, and the <i>New</i> and <i>Full</i>
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span><a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c017'><sup>[244]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>CONSIDERING</em> then that the <i>Ambient</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Air</em></span>
and the surrounding <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sea</em></span> are both <i>fluid Bodies</i>, and
that the <i>Changes</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>One</em></span> agree so exactly with
the <i>Tide</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Other</em></span>, we may rationally conclude,
that they are both (in a great measure) subject
to the same <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Laws</em></span> of <i>Motion</i><a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c017'><sup>[245]</sup></a>. Hence it is,
that, the great <i>Physician</i><a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c017'><sup>[246]</sup></a> says, that the <i>Fluxes</i>
and <i>Refluxes</i> of both these <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Elements</em></span> are
so ordain’d, by the Wise <i>Councell</i> of the Almighty
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Creator</em></span>, to keep them from <i>Stagnations</i> and
<i>Corruptions</i>, which would be noxious to all <i>Creatures</i>,
that by these means are preferred in a better Condition.
Which is also confirm’d by <i>Experience</i>, from
that, in clear and open places such <i>Valetudinarians</i> as are
ready to <i>Die</i>, recover their <i>Health</i>, and the <i>Soundest
Constitution</i> in moist close places, grows <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sick</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>FROM</em> the whole, it is evident, that the <i>Motions</i>
of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Air</em></span> at the flowing of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sea</em></span>, upon the
<i>New</i> and <i>Full</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Moon</em></span>, and in the <i>Æquinoxes</i>, change
the <i>Fabrick</i> of the <i>Animal Bodies</i>: But these
<i>Changes</i> are always most remarkable in those of <i>weak</i>
and <i>sickly Constitutions</i>; whereas those of <i>Strong</i> and
<i>Healthy Bodies</i> more readily repel or evade their <i>Influences</i>.
Hence it is that our <i>Bodies</i> so much <i>Sympathize</i>,
and so manifestly <i>correspond</i> with the <i>Cœlestials</i>,
as the Experience of a great many Ingenious <i>Authors</i>
testify<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c017'><sup>[247]</sup></a>: And hence again it is that the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hysterick</em></span>,
no less than any <i>other</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Patient</em></span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>keeps Time strictly with these <i>Superiour Bodies</i>, as the
<i>Register</i> of a vast many Examples, and even daily
<i>Experience</i> it self teaches for Truth. Now having
thus far prosecuted the <i>Diagnosticks</i>, as well with respect
to the <i>Times</i> and <i>Seasons</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Paroxysms</em></span>,
as to the <i>Signs</i> and <i>Symptoms</i> of the <i>Distemper</i>, I come
at length to——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THE</em> <i>Prognosticks</i> of this <i>Uterine</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>SuffocatioN</em></span>,
which I shall but briefly hint upon; and
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>First</em></span>, observe, that where the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Humours</em></span> overcharge
the <i>Body</i>, and are implicated among themselves;
in this <i>Case</i> the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Fits</em></span> do not always keep their
<i>Legitimate Times</i>, nor their <i>proper Insults</i>, but are sometimes
more <i>frequent</i>, more <i>sharp</i>, and more <i>diuturnal</i>;
in like manner, as a <i>Concourse</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Winds</em></span> excites
the most violent <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Storms</em></span>, according to the
<i>Poet</i><a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c017'><sup>[248]</sup></a>,</p>

<p class='c018'>So a <i>Concourse</i> and <i>Confluxion</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Humours</em></span>, must
needs aggravate the <i>Distemper</i>; but more especially,
when the afflicted <i><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i> is taken with a <i>Complication</i>
of <i>Distempers</i>, such as when the <i><em class='gesperrt'>HYSTERICK</em></i>
<i><em class='gesperrt'>FIT</em></i> is join’d with a <i>Syncope</i>, or severe <i>Convulsions</i>, &amp;c.
<i>then</i> the <i>Case</i> is most dangerous.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c017'><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>These Things, consisting in the <i>Corruption</i> and <i>Inflammation</i>,
or in the <i>Quantity</i> and <i>Quality</i> of the <i>peccant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span><em class='gesperrt'>HUMOURS</em></i>, concur with the <i>other Causes</i>, above defin’d,
that the <i>Circulations</i> of the <i>Distemper</i> are either
shorter or longer, more frequent or more rare, or more
safe or more dangerous in the Event.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>SECONDLY</em>, I observe in this place, that, if the
<i>Distemper</i> does not carry off the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i>, as often
happens in the foregoing <i>Condition</i>, it commonly degenerates
at last into an <i>Apoplexy</i>, or <i>Palsy</i>, <i>Stupidity</i>, or
deep <i>Melancholy</i>, &amp;c. Wherefore I come now <i>finally</i>
to treat of the Method of its <i>Cure</i>; which is twofold,
<i>One</i> in the <i>Access</i> or <i><em class='gesperrt'>FIT</em></i>, and <i>another</i> in the
<i>Interval</i>. Then as to the <i>First</i>——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IN</em> the <i><em class='gesperrt'>FIT</em></i>, <i>Revulsive</i> and <i>Repressing Remedies</i> are
most apposite, together with <i>Corroboratives</i> for the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>HEART</em></i> and <i><em class='gesperrt'>VENTRICLE</em></i>, as well as for the
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> it self. But because <i>Revulsives</i> are of many
and different kinds, they are to be discreetly us’d, according
to the Nature of the <i>Cause</i> from whence the
<i>Evil</i> proceeds: For if suppressed <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Blood</em></span> be the
<i>Cause</i>, in that <i>Case</i>, <i>Galen</i> agrees with <i>Hippocrates</i> that
an <i>Inferiour Vene-Section</i> is convenient, and that even
tho’ a <i>Syncope</i> join the <i><em class='gesperrt'>SUFFOCATION</em></i>, because the
<i>One</i> is but the Effect of the <i>Other</i><a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c017'><sup>[250]</sup></a>: Remembring always
that such <i>Bleedings</i> must be done with great Prudence
and Caution, because of the present <i>Prostration</i> of
the <i>Strength</i> and <i>Spirits</i>, and <i>Refrigeration</i> of the <span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></span>’s
whole Body.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREAS</em> if the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PAROXYSM</em></i> proceeds from
<i>venenated</i> <i><em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i>, or depraved <i>Humours</i>, no <i><em class='gesperrt'>VEIN</em></i>
is to be open’d; but instead of <i>That</i>, I would lay the
<i>Woman</i> supine in her <i><em class='gesperrt'>BED</em></i>, for breathing the freer,
and loose all her <i>Laces</i>, <i>Garters</i>, &amp;c. Then if Strong
<i>Sternutatories</i>, <i>Fœtid Smells</i>, <i>Vellication</i> of her <i>Ears</i>,
<i>Nostrils</i>, <i>Pilorumve Pudendi</i>, did not help her <i>Condition</i>;
I would use <i>dolorifick Ligatures</i>, and <i>Frictions</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>of <i><em class='gesperrt'>THIGHS</em></i>, <i><em class='gesperrt'>LEGS</em></i>, and <i><em class='gesperrt'>FEET</em></i>; or apply <i>Cupping
Glasses</i> without <i>Scarification</i> to the <i><em class='gesperrt'>THIGHS</em></i> and
<i><em class='gesperrt'>GROIN</em></i> it self: As also proper <i>Liniments</i>, <i>Clysters</i>,
<i>Suppositories</i>, <i>Pessaries</i>, &amp;c. are convenient Means: And
sometimes <i>Suffumigations</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>GALBANUM</em></i>, <i><em class='gesperrt'>ASSAFOETIDA</em></i>,
<i>Old Leather</i>, <i>Cloth</i>, <i>Sulphur</i>, <i>Partridge
Feathers</i>, <i>Horse-Tetters</i> or <i>Warts</i>, &amp;c. Or (which is
reckon’d <i>Best</i> of all) a few of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i>’s
<i>Hairs</i> of her <i>Head</i>, burnt, and held to her <i><em class='gesperrt'>NOSE</em></i>. Or,
while I should often tickle the <i><em class='gesperrt'>NOSTRILS</em></i> with a
<i>Feather</i>, or my <i>Finger</i> dipp’d in the sharpest <i>Vinegar</i>,
<i>Oleum Succini</i>, or the like, I would anoint the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PALLET</em></i>
with <i>Triacle</i>, <i>Mithridate</i>, or such other Things dissolv’d
in pleasant <i><em class='gesperrt'>WINE</em></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em>, in such <i>Cases</i>, as well as in all
others, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">à mitioribus adhibitis, progrediendum est ad valentiora</span></i>;
I say, we are to <i>begin with the more gentle, and
proceed gradually to the more strong and powerful <em class='gesperrt'>REMEDIES</em></i>;
using all proper Means with the utmost
Prudence and Discretion, and <i>that</i> only according to
the absolute Necessity and imminent Danger of the
<i>incident Case</i>. Now moreover, I would add for <i>such</i>
as lose both <i><em class='gesperrt'>PULSE</em></i> and <i><em class='gesperrt'>BREATH</em></i>, that some of
the above <i><em class='gesperrt'>REMEDIES</em></i> are not only requisite; but
also, according to the excellent <i>Horatius Augenius</i>, a
little generous <i><em class='gesperrt'>WINE</em></i> with <i>Nutmeg</i>, <i>Cinnamon</i> and
<i>Cloves</i>, adding <i>five Grains</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>MUSK</em></i>, is altogether
proper for <i>this <em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i><a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c017'><sup>[251]</sup></a>: Tho’ for <i>others</i>, who
have not quite lost all <i>Sense</i> and <i>Motion</i>, nothing is
perhaps more pernicious than the <i><em class='gesperrt'>USE</em></i> of such <i>Odoriferous
Matters</i>, since I have known several <i>Women</i> to
have been immediately <i>suffocated</i>, even by the very
<i>Smell</i> of <i><em class='gesperrt'>MUSK</em></i>, <i><em class='gesperrt'>CIVET</em></i>, <i><em class='gesperrt'>AMBER</em></i>, &amp;c. But
when the Sick <i><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i> lies (as above) for <i>dead</i>,
if such <i>Odours</i> can excite the <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>, they can likewise
move the <i>Arteries</i>, and give Hopes of <i>Recovery</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>upon which occasion also, I would apply hot <i>Sear-Cloths</i>
to the <i>Regions</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>HEART</em></i> and <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>:
Or, if I suspected the <i><em class='gesperrt'>HEAD</em></i> to abound with <i>frigid
Humours</i>, I would moreover apply <i>Vesicatories</i> behind
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>EARS</em></i>, or an <i>Issue</i>, or <i>drawing Plaister</i> to the
<i><em class='gesperrt'>NAPE</em></i> of the <i>Neck</i>, always cherishing the <i><em class='gesperrt'>STOMACH</em></i>
with proper <i>Fomentations</i>: As also according
to some, the <i>Hoof</i> of an <i><em class='gesperrt'>ELK</em></i>, is a present
<i><em class='gesperrt'>REMEDY</em></i> in all such <i>Suffocations</i> or <i><em class='gesperrt'>FITS</em> of the
Mother</i><a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c017'><sup>[252]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BY</em> the above-mentioned, which are all the most prevalent
<i>Means</i> in the <i><em class='gesperrt'>ACCESS</em></i>, we will now suppose
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>PATIENT</em></i> to be <i>recover’d</i>; in which <i>Case</i>, the
next step needful, is to guard against, and prevent
the <i>Return</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>FIT</em></i>, and consequently to <i>Cure</i>
the <i><em class='gesperrt'>DISEASE</em></i>; which can only be effected by
removing the <i>Cause</i>, whatever it may be: And <i>This</i>,
in my Opinion, may be most effectually perform’d in
manner following, <i>viz.</i>——</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>IF</em> the <i>Distemper</i> proceeds from the <i>suppressed <em class='gesperrt'>BLOOD</em></i>
or <i><em class='gesperrt'>MENSTRUA</em></i>, This is by proper <i>Means</i> to
be reduced to its <i>Natural Course</i> and <i>Condition</i>. If
from a retain’d <i>Seminal Matter</i> in the <i>Uterine Vessels</i>,
the <i>Cure</i> depends chiefly upon a proper <i>Regimen</i> of
<i>Diet</i> and <i>Exercise</i>; frequent gentle <i>Purges</i>, and repeated
inferiour <i>Venæ-Sections</i>: Whereas if already
collected and venenated in the <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>, and the
<i>Body</i> consequently <i>refrigerated</i>, no <i><em class='gesperrt'>VEIN</em></i> may properly
be touch’d or open’d; but in this <i>Case</i>, as if the <i>Evil</i>
proceeded from <i>vitious putrid <em class='gesperrt'>HUMOURS</em></i>, it is to
be evacuated in the same manner, as in <i>other Conditions</i>
of the <i>humid Intemperature</i> of the <i><em class='gesperrt'>WOMB</em></i>;
always corroborating and fortifying the more affected
or debilitated <i>Parts</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span><em class='gesperrt'>NOW</em> this Method of <i>Cure</i>, in short, being taken
from the wisest of the <i>Ancients</i><a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c017'><sup>[253]</sup></a>, I shall farther add
<i>one</i> singular and essential <i>Step</i> towards the perfecting
of it; namely, if it be so, that the most severe
and dangerous <i>Symptoms</i> of this <i><em class='gesperrt'>DISTEMPER</em></i> proceed
from the <i>Retention</i> of the <i>vitiated <em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i>; then
of Course and without Controversy, the <i>HYSTERICK
PASSION</i> must needs be most familiar to <i>WIDOWS</i>
and <i>marriageable <em class='gesperrt'>VIRGINS</em></i>; to whom I must finally
say, <i>Let them Marry</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><em class='gesperrt'>CONCLUSION.</em></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'><em class='gesperrt'>BEFORE</em> I close this finishing <i>Chapter</i>, I must
entreat the <i><em class='gesperrt'>READER</em></i>’s Patience, and finally
observe (by way of <i>Recapitulation</i> upon it, which will
also serve to Answer the same End upon divers places
interspers’d throughout this whole <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Book</em></span>) that I am
very Sensible before hand, that some considerate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span><em class='gesperrt'>Readers</em>, even among the <i>Learned</i> themselves,
will be ready to stop or cavil at some of my <i>Sentiments</i>,
and say, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo te Mœri Pedes? Et quæ te Dementia
cepit?</span></i></p>

<p class='c005'>I know that they deny, with the <i>Peripatetick Aristotle</i><a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c017'><sup>[255]</sup></a>,
the Existence of the <i>Muliebrian <em class='gesperrt'>SEED</em></i>. Nay,
I farther know, that, <i>this</i> is not all, which they will
<i>object</i> against; for the <i>Four Galenick <em class='gesperrt'>HUMOURS</em></i> will
be as hard to <i>digest</i>. But as I leave all <i>Men to think
and judge for themselves</i>, without differing with any
for dissenting from me in <i>Opinion</i>, so I know that
<i>Men of Probity</i> and <i>Ingenuity</i> will allow me the same
<i>Privilege</i> and act in a suitable Manner: Whereas I
doubt not but some <i>Momus</i>, or <i>Zoilus</i>, or some <i>Member</i>
of the Body of the <i>Sophistical</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sciolists</em></span> will
rise up, and pronounce me either altogether <i>Ignorant</i>,
or an unjust <i>Vilifier</i> of the reigning <i>Modern Opinions</i>,
by laying down some Authentick <i>Positions</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Antients</em></span>,</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>THIS</em> cannot more certainly befall me, than I expect
it; wherefore, I am not only in some measure
upon my <i>Guard</i>; but also otherways resolved to hear,
and even bear such <i>Controversial Wranglings</i> with Patience:
Which I need think the less of doing, or suffering
with Pleasure, considering the many Glorious <i>Examples</i>
already set before my Eyes of <i>Those</i> who have deserved
the greatest <i>Applause</i>, and the <i>Best</i> of Mankind in
all Ages. To pass by some living <i><em class='gesperrt'>MONUMENTS</em></i>
of <i>Detraction</i>, who are at this Day universally acknowledged
to be <i>Eminent</i> and <i>Excellent Men</i>; have not
some of the best <i>Authors</i> that ever wrote been unjustly
scourged by the <i>black Tongues</i>, and even scandaliz’d
by the <i>Satyrick Pens</i>, of their <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Cotemporaries</em></span>?
And are not the same <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sufferers</em></span>,
I mean their <i>Names</i> and <i>Memories</i> immortaliz’d at this
Time, through all <i>Nations</i>? Besides, in short, will
they not continue to be so through out all succeeding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span><i>Generations</i> for their essential <i>Helps</i> and ingenious
<i>Discoveries</i> in the Noble and Heavenly Art of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Physick</em></span>?
Moreover, have we not too many <i>Instances</i>
of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>This</em></span>, to go no farther, in <i>England</i>, even too well
known to require a <i>Repetition</i>?</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>HOW</em> vain then would it be in me to hope to
escape the Common <i>Fate</i> of all <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Writers</em></span> in general?
No, before ever I <i>put Pen to Paper</i>, I plainly
foresaw, that, in this degenerate Age, no honest
Man could safely subscribe to the genuine truth
of Things, without suffering by publick Malice, under
the <i>Character</i> of being reckon’d either an Ignorant
or an <i>obsolete</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Singularist</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>HOWEVER</em></span>, yet, as I would willingly avoid being
ranked among litigious <i>Disputants</i>, so I have taken
Care (if it be possible) to mitigate the <i>Censure</i>, by not
insisting too stiffly upon any <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Topick</em></span>, which may
be suppos’d to tend more to curious <i>Speculation</i>, than
to real <i>Practice</i> in our <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Art</em></span>: Neither have I set off
any <i>Hypothesis</i> with recommendatory <i>Glosses</i>, nor other
fine <i>Embellishments</i>, serving more for <i>Ornament</i> than <i>Use</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em> that I may not seem at last altogether to give
up, what I have been advancing, however in modest
<i>Terms</i> and upon authentick <i>Authorities</i>, I ingenuously
answer and confess, that, I have in diverse respects and
in sundry places in this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Book</em></span>, spoke my Mind freely,
and impartially, however without Prejudice, and <i>that</i>
sometimes also contrary to the <i>Opinions</i> of many famous
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Writers</em></span> in Vogue, as well <i>Ancient</i> as <i>Modern</i>;
by which means, I may perhaps have disgusted some,
otherways, most <i>Judicious</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Readers</em></span>: However,
considering the different <i>Grounds</i> upon which Men
commonly form their <i>Judgment</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Authors</em></span>,
if I have but the Happiness to please in some Things,
I have all that I am ambitious of.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>WHEREFORE</em>, as it was neither for <i>Applause</i>
nor <i>Reputation</i>-sake, but merely for the <i>Common Good</i>
of Mankind, that I undertook to write modestly, so
I resolved at the <i>Beginning</i>, that, neither <i>Malice</i> nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span><i>Envy</i> should deter me from publishing what is <i>True</i>,
and, to my certain Knowledge, confirmed by <i>Experience</i>.
I have carefully perus’d other Men’s
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Works</em></span>, <i>Moderns</i> as well as <i>Ancients</i>, to gain the
Knowledge and discover the <i>Truth of Things</i>, and I
gratefully acknowledge what <i>Benefit</i> soever I have
reaped from them, whose <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Names</em></span> I am not asham’d
to affix to this <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Book</em></span>, by the <i>Help</i> of their elaborate
and ingenious <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Writings</em></span>: Desiring thereby to
convince the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Revolver</em></span>, that I neither reject the
hard <i>Labours</i> of the <i>Ancients</i>, nor despise the laudable
<i>Endeavours</i> of the <i>Moderns</i>, <i>much less</i> would I be
thought to decry or find Fault with any particular
<i>Performance</i>; especially considering that I meet with
none so <i>empty</i>, but that I get something by, which I
emprove to my own Advantage.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='fss'><em class='gesperrt'>BUT</em></span> as far as I have found them mistaken, since
<i>Mortal Eyes</i> cannot see beyond their <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Horizon</em></span>,
nor the best of Men exceed the natural Limits of
<i>human Frailty</i>, I have thought it my <i>Duty</i> to forewarn
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Posterity</em></span> of their <i>Mistakes</i>, not only according
to the laudable <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Custom</em></span> of the <i>Ancients</i>, but also
according to my plain <i>Notion</i> of the genuine Nature
or true <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Charity</em></span>; which I think consists not in
contemning, detracting and calumniating <i>one another</i>,
but rather in cleansing <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Sciences</em></span> from the <i>Dross of
Errors</i>, that so the <i>Right Way</i> may be pav’d to our
<i>Successors</i> by a continued <i>Series</i> of Time, which may
be effectually done by <i>Many</i>, that cannot possibly be
accomplished by <i>One</i>; because of the <i>Brevity</i> of
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Life</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>UPON</em> the whole, it is most certain that <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Truth</em></span>
is known <i>but of a few</i>; whereas false <i>Opinions</i> go current
in the Stream with the rest of the World: Nay,
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Truth</em></span> scarce yet ever carried it by <i>Vote</i> in any respect,
insomuch, that the most evident Testimonies of
Sense, too often yield place to imbib’d Opinions, and
Men blindly reject the manifest Evidence of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>own Faculties, by which Truth in many Cases is only
to be discover’d: And indeed I know how hard it
is otherways to enquire exactly into the common
<i>Truth of Things</i>, so as to give a <i>Satisfactory Demonstration</i>,
or a <i>general Satisfaction</i> to <i>All</i>: Which
notwithstanding, I verily believe that the <i>Sons</i> of
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Art</em></span>, who know the <i>Principles</i> and <i>Power</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Nature</em></span>,
and understand her various <i>Operations</i> upon
all <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Bodies</em></span>, by the means of her inferiour <i>Agents</i>,
the four <i><em class='gesperrt'>ELEMENTS</em></i>; and such as have attain’d
any competent <i>Knowledge</i> in the <i><em class='gesperrt'>SPAGYRICK ANATOMY</em></i>
of Things, especially of <i>Fluids</i>, <i>Water</i>,
<i>Wine</i>, &amp;c. will be at no great Loss to conceive the
<i>Probability</i> of both the <i>one</i> and the <i>other</i> above-mentioned
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Hypothesis</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c005'><em class='gesperrt'>ACCEPT</em> then, in fine, <i>Benevolent</i> <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Reader</em></span>,
<i>This</i> short and plain <i>Performance</i> of <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Physick</em></span> and
<span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Midwifery</em></span>; which, if it should not happily answer
to your <i>Expectation</i>, I would fain have you believe,
that it will far less correspond with my <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Wish</em></span>.
If then any Thing be found <i>useful</i> or <i>acceptable</i> in it,
you are to ascribe that to <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>God</em></span>, the <i>Author</i> of all
<i>Wisdom</i>; you may impute what is otherways perform’d,
to <i>Man</i>’s Understanding and Practice blessed
by <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>God</em></span>: Therefore being every where mindful
of <i>Humanity</i>, <i>read</i>, <i>revolve</i>, <i>enjoy</i>, and <i>correct</i>; <i>reflecting</i>
in the <i>Interim</i>, not so much upon the <i>little that</i> I
have done, as upon <i>that</i> which others have not
hitherto perform’d concerning the same <i>Subject</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>I could with <i>Pleasure</i> have continued <i>The Performance</i>,
and, according to my <i>Design</i> at the <i>Beginning</i>, have
added two <i><em class='gesperrt'>SECTIONS</em></i> more, <i>viz.</i> <i>One</i> upon the
<i>Symptoms</i> and <i>Diseases</i> of the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Womb</em></span> and the
<i>Passages</i>; the <i>other</i> upon the various <i>Symptoms</i> or
<i>Accidents</i>, relating to the <i><em class='gesperrt'>MENSTRUOUS</em></i> and
other <i>Uterine Fluxes</i>: But as the <span class='sc'><em class='gesperrt'>Work</em></span> has already
by far exceeded the <i>Limits</i>, which I design’d it

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away&mdash;you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

To protect the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&trade; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&trade; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&trade; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work (any work
on which the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&trade;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&trade; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; License.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&trade; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain

full Project Gutenberg&trade; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>

        You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&trade; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
